# Understanding the Importance of System Design in Software Engineering

System design is essential in software engineering because it ensures that software systems are scalable, reliable, maintainable, performant, cost-effective, secure, adaptable, and user-friendly. By investing time and effort into designing robust and efficient systems, organizations can build high-quality software products that meet the needs of their users and stakeholders.

# Requirements Gathering, Classifying, and Analyzing

1. **Purpose**:
   - Determine what needs to be built for the client.
   - Clarify high-level and vague requirements, often provided by non-technical clients.

2. **Challenges**:
   - **Scope and Ambiguity**: Large-scale systems involve broader scope and higher ambiguity than smaller tasks.
   - **Communication**: Transform vague client requests into precise technical requirements.

3. **Importance**:
   - Ensuring accurate requirements upfront is critical to avoid costly rework and delays.
   - Large projects involve significant engineering time, hardware, software licenses, and contractual obligations.

4. **Types of Requirements**:
   - **Functional Requirements (Features)**:
     - Describe the system's behavior and functionalities (e.g., user login, payment processing).
   - **Non-Functional Requirements (Quality Attributes)**:
     - Define properties like scalability, reliability, performance, and security.
   - **System Constraints**:
     - Include limitations such as deadlines, budget, and team size.

5. **Architectural Drivers**:
   - Requirements that influence architectural decisions and shape the system's design.

# Capturing and Documenting Functional Requirements

1. **Purpose**:
   - Define and document functional requirements methodically.

2. **Challenges**:
   - Complexity and ambiguity, especially with many features and actors.

3. **Methodology**:
   - **Use Cases and User Flows**: 
     - **Use Case**: Describes specific scenarios where the system is used to achieve a user's goal.
     - **User Flow**: Detailed, often graphical, representation of each use case.

4. **Steps to Capture Functional Requirements**:
   1. **Identify Actors**: 
      - Determine all users and actors interacting with the system.
   2. **Describe Use Cases**: 
      - List all scenarios of interaction between actors and the system.
   3. **Expand Use Cases**: 
      - Detail the flow of events and interactions in each use case, capturing actions and data flow.

5. **Example - Hitchhiking Service**:
   - **Actors**: Driver and Rider.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - User registration (Rider and Driver).
     - Logging in to initiate a ride.
     - Successful match between Rider and Driver.
     - Unsuccessful match (no driver found).

6. **Sequence Diagrams**:
   - Used to represent interactions between actors and the system.
   - **Features**:
     - Time progresses from top to bottom.
     - Entities represented as vertical lines.
     - Communication shown as arrows; responses as broken lines.

7. **Application of Sequence Diagrams**:
   - Example: Successful match in hitchhiking service.
   - Steps include driver availability, rider request, matching process, ride initiation, ride completion, payment, and notifications.

8. **API Identification**:
   - Each interaction in the user flow can correspond to an API call.
   - Data flowing between actors and the system forms the basis for API arguments.

9. **Key Takeaway**:
   - The three-step process and sequence diagrams provide a structured way to capture and visualize functional requirements, aiding in system design and API identification.


# Quality Attributes (Nonfunctional Requirements)

1. **Motivation**:
   - Systems are often redesigned due to inadequate quality attributes, not because of functional deficiencies.
   - Proper architecture that addresses quality attributes can prevent costly redesigns.

2. **Definition**:
   - Quality attributes describe the qualities of the system's functionality, measuring performance on specific dimensions.
   - They do not specify what the system does, but how well it performs.

3. **Examples**:
   - **Performance**: System responds to a search query within 100 milliseconds.
   - **Availability**: Online store available 99.9% of the time.
   - **Deployability**: System can be updated with new versions at least twice a week.

4. **Key Considerations**:
   1. **Measurability and Testability**:
      - Quality attributes must be quantifiable and verifiable.
      - E.g., defining "quickly" in terms of specific time, like 200 milliseconds.

   2. **Trade-offs**:
      - No single architecture can optimize all quality attributes.
      - Conflicting requirements require prioritization (e.g., speed vs. security in login processes).

   3. **Feasibility**:
      - Ensure the system can realistically meet the quality attributes.
      - Unrealistic expectations (e.g., 100% availability, perfect security) should be addressed early.

5. **Examples of Unfeasible Requirements**:
   - Unrealistic low latency (e.g., sub-100ms page loads with high network latency).
   - 100% system availability (no maintenance or upgrades).
   - Full protection against hackers.
   - Streaming high-resolution content in low-bandwidth areas.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Quality attributes are critical for system success.
   - They must be measurable, involve trade-offs, and be feasible.
   - Proper consideration of these attributes helps avoid major redesigns and ensures system reliability and performance.

# System Constraints

1. **Definition**:
   - System constraints are pre-determined decisions that restrict architectural choices, either fully or partially. They can be viewed as non-negotiable guidelines that shape the architecture.

2. **Types of System Constraints**:
   - **Technical Constraints**:
     - Related to hardware, cloud vendors, programming languages, databases, platforms, browsers, or operating systems.
     - Example: Using a specific database due to existing infrastructure.

   - **Business Constraints**:
     - Arising from budget, deadlines, or business strategies.
     - Example: Limited budget or a strict deadline influences the choice of architecture.

   - **Legal Constraints**:
     - Related to regulations and laws specific to regions or industries.
     - Example: Compliance with HIPAA for healthcare systems or GDPR for handling personal data in the EU.

3. **Considerations**:
   1. **Distinguishing Real vs. Self-Imposed Constraints**:
      - Determine if constraints are truly non-negotiable or if there's room for flexibility.
      - Example: Re-evaluating the need for specific technologies or exploring alternative vendors.

   2. **Avoiding Tight Coupling**:
      - Design the architecture to allow future flexibility and minimize dependency on specific constraints.
      - Example: Abstracting the interaction with a specific database or third-party service to facilitate easy replacement.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - System constraints are a key architectural driver that define the boundaries within which the system must operate.
   - Properly identifying and managing these constraints helps in creating a resilient and adaptable architecture.
   - Ensuring flexibility in the system design allows for easier adaptation to future changes and potential relaxation of constraints.

# Quality Attribute: Performance

1. **Overview**:
   - Performance is a crucial quality attribute in large-scale systems. It encompasses various metrics that measure how efficiently a system processes requests and data.

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **Response Time**:
     - Defined as the time taken between sending a request and receiving a response. It includes:
       - **Processing Time**: Time spent actively handling the request within the system.
       - **Waiting Time**: Time spent in transit or in queues, often referred to as latency or end-to-end latency.
     - Importance: Critical for user experience, especially in systems where immediate feedback is expected.

   - **Throughput**:
     - Measures the amount of work or data processed by the system per unit of time.
     - Can be expressed as tasks per second or data (bytes) per second.
     - Importance: Vital for systems handling large volumes of data, such as logging or analytics systems.

3. **Considerations for Measuring Performance**:
   1. **Accurate Measurement of Response Time**:
      - Ensure that both processing and waiting times are considered to avoid misleading conclusions about system performance.

   2. **Response Time Distribution Analysis**:
      - Use histograms and percentile distributions to understand the range of response times experienced by users.
      - Key terms:
        - **Median**: The 50th percentile, indicating the response time for 50% of requests.
        - **Tail Latency**: The response times in the higher percentiles (e.g., 95th, 99th), indicating the longest delays experienced by a small percentage of users.
      - Setting Goals: Define acceptable response times in terms of percentiles, e.g., 95th percentile response time should be under 30 milliseconds.

   3. **Performance Degradation**:
      - Identify the point at which performance degrades as load increases.
      - Key factors include CPU utilization, memory consumption, network limitations, and queue capacities.
      - Importance: Understanding degradation helps in capacity planning and ensuring system stability under load.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Performance metrics like response time and throughput are essential for assessing system efficiency and user experience.
   - Proper measurement and analysis of these metrics, including consideration of tail latency and performance degradation, are crucial for maintaining a high-quality system.

### Quality Attribute: Scalability

1. **Motivation for Scalability**:
   - System load or traffic is dynamic and can vary based on seasonal patterns, daily fluctuations, global events, and business growth.
   - As the load increases, systems may reach a performance degradation point, beyond which performance declines.

2. **Definition of Scalability**:
   - Scalability is the ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work in a cost-effective and easy manner by adding resources.
   - Ideal scalability scenarios include:
     - **Linear Scalability**: Doubling resources results in doubling the amount of work the system can handle.
     - **Diminishing Returns**: Adding resources provides decreasing increments in performance improvement.
     - **Negative Scalability**: Adding resources worsens performance due to overhead and coordination costs.

3. **Scalability Dimensions**:
   1. **Vertical Scalability (Scaling Up)**:
      - Involves upgrading the existing hardware (e.g., faster CPUs, more memory) to handle increased load.
      - **Pros**:
        - Simple to implement; does not typically require code changes.
        - Easy migration, especially with cloud services.
      - **Cons**:
        - Limited by the maximum capacity of a single machine.
        - Centralized system design, which lacks high availability and fault tolerance.

   2. **Horizontal Scalability (Scaling Out)**:
      - Involves adding more instances of the same resource, such as multiple servers or databases, to distribute the load.
      - **Pros**:
        - Virtually unlimited scalability potential.
        - Can inherently provide high availability and fault tolerance.
      - **Cons**:
        - More complex to implement and manage, requiring significant changes in system architecture.
        - Increased coordination and management overhead.

   3. **Team or Organizational Scalability**:
      - Focuses on increasing the productivity of the development team as more engineers are hired.
      - **Challenges**:
        - Increased coordination overhead, meetings, and merge conflicts as team size grows.
        - Larger codebases require more onboarding and testing time, slowing down productivity.
      - **Solutions**:
        - Modularization: Splitting the codebase into separate modules or libraries to reduce interference.
        - Microservices: Breaking down a monolithic application into independent services with separate codebases and release cycles.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Scalability is a critical quality attribute that ensures a system can grow and adapt to increasing demands.
   - It can be achieved through vertical scalability (upgrading hardware), horizontal scalability (adding more instances), and team scalability (enhancing team productivity).
   - Understanding and implementing scalability strategies helps maintain system performance, reliability, and organizational efficiency as the system and team grow.

# Quality Attribute: Availability

1. **Importance of High Availability**:
   - **User Impact**: Availability directly affects user experience. Downtime can lead to frustration and loss of trust, especially if critical services (e.g., e-commerce, email, mission-critical systems) are inaccessible.
   - **Business Impact**:
     - **Revenue Loss**: When systems are down, the ability to generate revenue halts.
     - **Customer Loss**: Frequent or prolonged outages can drive users to competitors.

2. **Defining Availability**:
   - **Availability**: The fraction of time or probability that a service is operational and accessible to users.
   - **Uptime**: The time when the system is operational and accessible.
   - **Downtime**: The time when the system is not operational or accessible.

3. **Measuring Availability**:
   - **Basic Formula**: 
     \[
     \text{Availability} = \frac{\text{Uptime}}{\text{Uptime} + \text{Downtime}}
     \]
   - **MTBF and MTTR**:
     - **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)**: The average time the system operates without failure.
     - **MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery)**: The average time taken to detect and recover from a failure.
     - **Alternative Formula**:
       \[
       \text{Availability} = \frac{\text{MTBF}}{\text{MTBF} + \text{MTTR}}
       \]
     - This formula indicates that minimizing MTTR can significantly improve availability, even if MTBF is not optimal.

4. **Acceptable Levels of Availability**:
   - **100% Availability**: Ideal but impractical due to maintenance and unexpected failures.
   - **Industry Standards**:
     - **90% Availability**: Over two hours of downtime per day, not considered high availability.
     - **95% Availability**: About one hour of downtime per day, still insufficient for most use cases.
     - **99.9% Availability (Three Nines)**: Less than 1.5 minutes of downtime per day, generally acceptable.
     - **99.99% Availability (Four Nines)**: Less than 52.6 minutes of downtime per year, highly reliable.

   - **Terminology**: Availability percentages are often referred to by the number of nines (e.g., "three nines" for 99.9%).


# Achieving High Availability: Fault Tolerance Strategies

1. **Sources of Failures**:
   - **Human Error**: Mistakes like deploying faulty configurations, incorrect commands, or untested software versions.
   - **Software Errors**: Problems such as long garbage collections, crashes (out-of-memory exceptions, null pointer exceptions, segmentation faults), etc.
   - **Hardware Failures**: Issues like server, router, or storage device failures due to end-of-life, power outages from natural disasters, or network problems.

2. **Fault Tolerance Overview**:
   - **Definition**: The ability of a system to remain operational and available to users despite failures in one or more components.
   - **Objective**: Ensure system operation at the same or reduced performance level, preventing complete unavailability.

3. **Fault Tolerance Tactics**:

   - **Failure Prevention**:
     - **Eliminating Single Points of Failure**:
       - **Replication and Redundancy**: 
         - **Multiple Instances**: Run applications or databases on multiple servers to avoid single points of failure.
         - **Time Redundancy**: Repeating operations until successful or abandoned.
       - **Architectural Strategies**:
         - **Active-Active Architecture**: All replicas handle requests and must stay synchronized. Offers scalability but requires complex coordination.
         - **Active-Passive Architecture**: A primary replica handles all requests, with passive replicas maintaining state through periodic snapshots. Easier to implement but limits scalability.

   - **Failure Detection and Isolation**:
     - **Monitoring Systems**:
       - **Health Checks and Heartbeats**: Regular checks to ensure instances are operational.
       - **Detection of Faulty Instances**: Monitoring for software or hardware issues and isolating affected instances.
       - **False Positives vs. False Negatives**: Prioritizing avoiding false negatives, where a failure is undetected, over false positives.

   - **Recovery from Failure**:
     - **Traffic Management**: Redirect traffic from faulty instances.
     - **Restart Procedures**: Attempt to resolve issues by restarting affected instances.
     - **Rollbacks**: Revert to a stable version if the current one causes issues, commonly used in databases to maintain data integrity and system stability.



# Key Terms in Service Level Management

1. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**:
   - **Definition**: A legal contract between the service provider and users that outlines the quality of service commitments, such as availability, performance, data durability, and response times to failures.
   - **Components**: Specifies penalties or compensation if the provider fails to meet the promised quality of service, such as refunds, service credits, or extensions.
   - **Application**: Primarily for external paying users, but can also apply to free users (e.g., trial extensions) and sometimes internal users.

2. **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**:
   - **Definition**: Specific, measurable goals set for a system, representing target values or ranges for key metrics.
   - **Examples**: Availability (e.g., three nines), response time (e.g., <100ms at the 90th percentile), issue resolution time (e.g., 24-48 hours).
   - **Relation to SLA**: SLOs are components of an SLA, detailing specific commitments. Systems without an SLA still need SLOs to set user expectations.

3. **Service Level Indicators (SLIs)**:
   - **Definition**: Quantitative metrics used to assess whether SLOs are being met. They are derived from monitoring systems or log analysis.
   - **Examples**: Percentage of successful responses (for availability), response times, error rates.
   - **Purpose**: To measure actual performance against SLO targets and ensure compliance with SLAs.

### Considerations for Defining SLOs

1. **User-Centric Metrics**: Focus on the metrics that matter most to users and define SLOs around them. Select SLIs that accurately track these metrics.

2. **Minimal and Focused SLOs**: Limit the number of SLOs to prioritize key objectives and simplify system architecture. Too many SLOs can dilute focus and complicate management.

3. **Realistic and Conservative Goals**: Set achievable goals with a margin for error. Avoid over-promising by aligning external commitments conservatively compared to internal goals.

4. **Recovery Plan**: Prepare a plan for situations where SLIs indicate potential breaches of SLOs. This includes automatic alerts, failovers, restarts, rollbacks, auto-scaling policies, and handbooks for incident management.


These terms and considerations are crucial for designing reliable systems that meet user expectations and contractual obligations.

# Designing an Application Programming Interface (API)

## Introduction and Motivation

An API is a contract between the developers who implement a system and the client applications that use it. For large-scale systems, APIs are typically accessed remotely over a network. These client applications can include front-end clients (like mobile apps or web browsers), other backend systems, or internal systems within an organization.

## Types of APIs

1. **Public APIs**:
   - **Definition**: Exposed to the general public; any developer can use them.
   - **Access Control**: Often require user registration to manage and monitor usage, enhance security, and enable blacklisting.

2. **Private APIs**:
   - **Definition**: Only accessible internally within a company, allowing different teams or departments to leverage the system's capabilities.

3. **Partner APIs**:
   - **Definition**: Similar to public APIs but restricted to users or companies with a business relationship, often defined by a customer agreement.

## Benefits of a Well-Defined API

- **Ease of Use**: Clients can enhance their business by integrating with the system without needing to understand its internal workings.
- **Parallel Development**: Clients can start integrating with the system based on the API definition, even before the system's implementation is complete.
- **Internal Architecture**: Defining the API helps in designing the internal structure by establishing clear endpoints and routes for different functionalities.
## Best Practices and Patterns for API Design

1. **Encapsulation**:
   - **Goal**: Hide internal design and implementation details from API users.
   - **Benefit**: Allows internal changes without breaking the API contract.

2. **Ease of Use and Simplicity**:
   - **Guidelines**: 
     - Provide a single way to perform tasks.
     - Use descriptive names for actions and resources.
     - Expose only necessary information and actions.
     - Maintain consistency throughout the API.

3. **Idempotency**:
   - **Definition**: Operations that produce the same result even if performed multiple times.
   - **Importance**: Ensures safe retrying of requests in case of network issues, as multiple requests won't alter the outcome.

4. **Pagination**:
   - **Purpose**: Handle large datasets by dividing them into manageable chunks.
   - **Example**: Displaying a limited number of emails or search results at a time, rather than overwhelming the client with the entire dataset.

5. **Asynchronous Operations**:
   - **Use Case**: For long-running tasks where partial results aren't meaningful (e.g., big data analysis, large file compression).
   - **Mechanism**: Clients receive an immediate response with a tracking identifier to check the status and retrieve the final result later.

6. **API Versioning**:
   - **Purpose**: Manage changes over time, especially non-backward compatible updates.
   - **Approach**: Maintain multiple API versions, allowing clients to transition gradually while maintaining stability.

### Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)

#### Introduction and How It Works

A **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** allows a client application to execute a subroutine on a remote server, making the call appear like a local method invocation. This concept, known as **local transparency**, simplifies the developer's experience as the remote method call syntax closely resembles that of local methods. RPCs often support multiple programming languages, enabling interoperability between different systems.

![Remote Procedure Calls](./images/rpc-code-generation.png)

**Key Components:**
1. **Interface Description Language (IDL)**:
   - Defines the API and data types used in the methods.
   - Serves as a schema for communication between the client and server.

2. **Stubs**:
   - **Client Stub**: Auto-generated implementation for the client, handles serialization (marshalling) of data, and initiates the connection to the server.
   - **Server Stub**: Auto-generated implementation on the server, listens for client messages, deserializes (unmarshalling) data, and invokes the corresponding method.

3. **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**:
   - Auto-generated classes or structs representing custom data types defined in the IDL.

**Process Flow**:
- The client calls an RPC method, the client stub serializes the data and sends it to the server.
- The server stub receives, deserializes, and processes the request, then returns the result.
- The client stub receives and deserializes the response, providing the result to the caller.

#### Benefits of RPC

1. **Convenience**:
   - Simplifies the developer's task by abstracting away the complexities of network communication.
   - Error handling is straightforward, with communication failures resulting in exceptions or errors similar to local method calls.

2. **Language and Platform Agnosticism**:
   - Multiple programming languages can be used for both client and server implementations.

#### Drawbacks of RPC

1. **Slowness**:
   - Unlike local methods, RPC calls involve network communication, which can introduce latency and unpredictability in performance.
   - Developers may inadvertently block execution while waiting for slow RPC responses, making it necessary to provide asynchronous versions of potentially slow methods.

2. **Unreliability**:
   - Network issues can cause messages to be lost or delayed, leading to confusion about the state of operations. For instance, a failed transaction might leave the client unsure whether an operation was completed.

**Mitigation**:
   - Use idempotent operations to ensure repeated calls have the same effect, minimizing risks in case of communication failures.

#### When to Use RPC

- **Backend-to-Backend Communication**:
  - Ideal for communication between different backend systems or components within a large-scale system.

- **Complete Abstraction**:
  - Suitable when the goal is to abstract network communication details and focus solely on the actions performed.

- **Action-Oriented APIs**:
  - RPCs are well-suited for APIs focused on actions rather than data or resources, with methods representing distinct actions.

#### When Not to Use RPC

- **Frontend Clients**:
  - Generally less common for frontend clients like web browsers.

- **Need for Network Details**:
  - Not ideal when direct access to network elements like HTTP cookies or headers is required.

- **Data-Centric APIs**:
  - For APIs centered around data and CRUD operations, other styles may be more appropriate.

### REST API: Representational State Transfer

#### Introduction and Overview

**REST** stands for **Representational State Transfer**, an architectural style introduced by Roy Fielding in 2000. Unlike standards or protocols, REST provides a set of constraints and best practices for designing APIs, primarily for the web. A **RESTful API** adheres to these principles, offering a resource-oriented approach rather than a method-centric one, as seen in RPC APIs.

**Key Characteristics of REST APIs**:
1. **Resource-Oriented**: The primary focus is on resources, which represent entities within the system.
2. **Statelessness**: Each request from a client contains all the information needed for the server to fulfill the request.
3. **Cacheability**: Responses are explicitly labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable, aiding performance and reducing server load.

#### Comparison with RPC

- **RPC**: Focuses on exposing methods and functions to perform operations.
- **REST**: Emphasizes resources, where operations are limited to a few standard methods.

#### REST API Concepts

1. **Resources and URIs**:
   - Resources represent entities and are accessed using **Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)**.
   - Organized hierarchically, resources can be simple (individual entities) or collections (groups of entities).

2. **Resource Representations**:
   - Resources are represented in various formats like JSON, XML, HTML, or others.
   - The server provides a representation of the resource's state, which can differ from its internal implementation.

3. **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)**:
   - REST APIs often include hypermedia links in responses, guiding clients on possible next actions.

#### Key Benefits of REST APIs

1. **Scalability**: Statelessness allows easy load distribution across multiple servers.
2. **High Availability**: No dependency on session state enables failover and redundancy.
3. **Performance**: Caching reduces latency and server load.

#### Naming and Organizing Resources

- **Best Practices**:
  - Use **nouns** for resource names to clearly distinguish resources from actions.
  - Distinguish between **collection resources** (plural names) and **simple resources** (singular names).
  - Ensure resource names are **clear and meaningful**, avoiding generic terms like "items" or "objects".
  - Resource identifiers should be **unique** and **URL-friendly**.

#### Operations on REST API Resources

1. **Standard HTTP Methods**:
   - **POST**: Create a new resource.
   - **GET**: Retrieve the state of a resource or a list of resources in a collection.
   - **PUT**: Update an existing resource.
   - **DELETE**: Remove a resource.

2. **Idempotency**:
   - Methods like GET, PUT, and DELETE are idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request.

3. **Safety and Cacheability**:
   - GET requests are safe (do not modify resource state) and cacheable. POST requests can also be cacheable with appropriate headers.

#### Designing a REST API: A Step-by-Step Example

**Example: Movie Streaming Service**

1. **Identify Entities**:
   - Users, movies, reviews, actors.

2. **Map Entities to URIs**:
   - Define resources and their hierarchy, e.g., `/movies`, `/movies/{movieId}`, `/movies/{movieId}/reviews`.

3. **Define Representations**:
   - Use JSON to represent resource states, e.g., a movie's information and links to related resources like reviews and actors.

4. **Assign HTTP Methods**:
   - Example operations:
     - **POST** on `/users`: Register a new user.
     - **GET** on `/users/{userId}`: Retrieve user information.
     - **PUT** on `/users/{userId}`: Update user profile.
     - **DELETE** on `/users/{userId}`: Remove a user.

#### Conclusion

REST API design emphasizes a resource-oriented approach with a small set of standard operations. This style facilitates high performance, scalability, and ease of use. By following best practices and leveraging HTTP methods, developers can create robust and intuitive APIs.

# Key Principles and Goals of System Design

System design aims to achieve several key principles and goals to ensure the success and effectiveness of software systems. Here's a deep dive into some of the most important ones:

## Scalability

- **Description:** Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle increasing loads or demands by adding resources or scaling out horizontally without significantly impacting performance.
- **Principles:**
  - Horizontal scalability: Adding more instances of components or distributing workload across multiple nodes to handle increased traffic.
  - Vertical scalability: Increasing the capacity of individual components, such as upgrading hardware resources or optimizing algorithms.
- **Goals:**
  - Ensure responsiveness and performance under high loads.
  - Enable growth and accommodate increases in user base or data volume.
  - Minimize downtime and maintain service availability during scaling operations.

## Reliability

- **Description:** Reliability refers to the ability of a system to consistently perform its intended functions under normal and adverse conditions without unexpected failures or errors.
- **Principles:**
  - Fault tolerance: Designing systems to continue operating even in the presence of hardware failures, software bugs, or network issues.
  - Redundancy: Duplication of critical components or data to eliminate single points of failure and increase system resilience.
- **Goals:**
  - Ensure high uptime and availability of services.
  - Minimize the impact of failures on system functionality and user experience.
  - Implement robust error handling, monitoring, and recovery mechanisms to detect and respond to failures proactively.

## Availability

- **Description:** Availability refers to the ability of a system to remain operational and accessible to users, typically measured as the percentage of time that the system is functional and responsive.

# Introduction to Software Architectural Patterns

## What Are Software Architectural Patterns?

Software architectural patterns are general, repeatable solutions to commonly occurring system design problems. Unlike design patterns—such as singleton, factory, or strategy—which organize code within a single application, architectural patterns address problems involving multiple components running as separate runtime units, like applications or services.

Over time, software architects have observed how companies in similar industries solved design challenges. They identified successful strategies and learned from others' mistakes, thus forming software architectural patterns.

## Why Use Software Architectural Patterns?

1. **Efficiency and Resource Savings**: Leveraging proven solutions can save time and resources. If a pattern has worked for organizations with similar challenges, it often makes sense to adopt it rather than reinvent the wheel.

2. **Avoiding Anti-Patterns**: One significant risk is creating a "big ball of mud," an anti-pattern characterized by a lack of structure, tightly coupled services, global or duplicated information, and unclear component responsibilities. Such systems are difficult to develop, maintain, and scale, potentially harming the business.

3. **Consistency and Continuity**: Using well-known patterns ensures that other engineers and architects can easily understand and continue working within the same architectural framework. This consistency simplifies maintenance and evolution.

## Flexibility and Evolution

Architectural patterns are guidelines, not rigid rules. The goal is to define the best architecture for the specific use case and adapt the patterns as necessary. As systems evolve, the chosen pattern may no longer fit, necessitating a migration to a different pattern. Many companies have successfully navigated such transitions, providing best practices for smooth and safe migrations.

### Event Sourcing and CQRS

#### Overview:

Event Sourcing and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) are architectural patterns used in building complex and scalable software systems. While they are often used together, each pattern serves distinct purposes in designing and implementing robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.

#### Event Sourcing:

Event Sourcing is a pattern where the state of an application is determined by a sequence of events that are stored as a log. Instead of storing the current state of an entity, Event Sourcing stores a series of state-changing events. These events represent facts that describe changes to the system's state over time. By replaying these events, the application can reconstruct the current state of the system at any point in time. Event Sourcing provides an immutable audit log of all changes to the system, enabling features such as auditing, versioning, and temporal querying.

# Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS):

CQRS is a pattern that separates the responsibility of handling commands (write operations) from queries (read operations) into separate components. In a CQRS architecture, commands are responsible for mutating the state of the system, while queries are responsible for retrieving data from the system. By decoupling read and write operations, CQRS enables greater flexibility, scalability, and performance optimization. CQRS allows for the optimization of read and write models independently, allowing each to be tailored to their specific requirements. This can lead to improved performance, scalability, and maintainability.

## Key Components:

# Architectural Building Blocks

## API Gateway

### Overview

An API Gateway is an API management service that acts as an intermediary between clients and backend services. It uses the API composition pattern to aggregate multiple backend services into a single API endpoint that clients interact with. This abstraction provides several key benefits:

![API Gateway](./images/api-gateway.png)

### Benefits of an API Gateway

1. **Seamless Internal Changes**:
   - Facilitates internal system changes without impacting external API consumers. For example, it enables the splitting of a frontend service into different services for various devices without altering the external API.

2. **Consolidated Security**:
   - Centralizes security, authentication, and authorization. The API Gateway can handle SSL termination, enforce rate limits, and control access, ensuring secure interactions and protecting against malicious requests.

3. **Improved Performance**:
   - **Request Routing**: Routes client requests to the appropriate backend services and aggregates responses into a single response, reducing the number of client-side calls.
   - **Caching**: Stores responses to common requests, improving response times by serving cached data instead of querying backend services repeatedly.

4. **Enhanced Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Provides real-time visibility into system traffic patterns and load. Enables monitoring and alerting for traffic anomalies, helping in system observability and proactive issue management.

5. **Protocol Translation**:
   - Handles protocol and format translation between clients and backend services. Supports integration with various external systems by converting different protocols and data formats as needed.

### Best Practices and Anti-Patterns

1. **Avoid Business Logic**:
   - The API Gateway should not include business logic. Its primary functions should be API composition and request routing. Adding business logic can lead to a monolithic architecture and undermine the benefits of service decomposition.

2. **Single Point of Failure**:
   - An API Gateway can become a single point of failure. To address this, deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer and ensure robust release management to prevent service disruptions.

3. **Performance Overhead**:
   - While an API Gateway introduces some performance overhead, the overall benefits generally outweigh this. Avoid bypassing or over-optimizing the API Gateway, as this can reintroduce tight coupling and complicate client interactions.

## Load Balancer

A **load balancer** is a fundamental building block in software architecture, especially for large-scale systems. Its primary role is to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers, ensuring no single server is overwhelmed. This distribution helps achieve high availability and horizontal scalability by running multiple instances of an application on different servers.

![Load balancer](./images/load-balancer.png)

### Motivation for Using Load Balancers

Without a load balancer, a client application would need to know the addresses and number of server instances directly. This tight coupling makes it challenging to modify the system's internal structure without affecting the client application. Load balancers provide an abstraction layer, making the entire system appear as a single server with immense computing power and memory.

### Quality Attributes Provided by Load Balancers

1. **High Scalability**: 
   - Allows for scaling the system horizontally by adding or removing servers based on demand. In cloud environments, this can be automated with policies that react to metrics like request rate and bandwidth usage.

2. **High Availability**: 
   - Load balancers can monitor server health and route traffic only to healthy servers, ensuring continuous availability even if some servers fail.

3. **Performance**: 
   - While load balancers may introduce minimal latency, they enable higher throughput by distributing requests across multiple servers.

4. **Maintainability**: 
   - Facilitates rolling updates and maintenance by allowing servers to be taken offline for upgrades without disrupting the overall system.

#### Types of Load Balancers

1. **DNS Load Balancing**:

![DNS Load Balancing](./images/dns-loadbalancing.png)

   - Uses DNS to map a domain name to multiple IP addresses. The list of addresses is rotated, balancing the load. However, this method lacks health checks and only supports simple round-robin strategies, making it less reliable and secure.

2. **Hardware Load Balancers**:
   - Dedicated devices optimized for load balancing tasks. They offer features like health checks, intelligent traffic distribution, and can secure the system by hiding internal server details.

3. **Software Load Balancers**:
   - Programs running on general-purpose hardware. They provide similar features to hardware load balancers but can be more flexible and cost-effective.

4. **Global Server Load Balancer (GSLB)**:

![GSLB](./images/gs-load-balancing.png)

   - Combines DNS and load balancer functionalities, intelligently routing users based on location, server load, response time, and more. GSLBs are essential for multi-data center deployments and disaster recovery scenarios.

## Message Brokers: The Building Block for Asynchronous Architectures

A message broker is a software component that uses the queue data structure to store and manage messages between senders and receivers. Unlike load balancers, which manage external traffic and are visible to clients, message brokers operate internally within a system and are not exposed externally.

### Synchronous Communication Drawbacks

In synchronous communication, both the sender and receiver must be active and maintain an open connection for the transaction to complete. This can lead to several issues:
- **Connection Dependence**: Both services must be healthy and running simultaneously.
- **Long Processing Times**: Services that take a long time to process requests can cause delays and hold up the entire system.
- **Traffic Handling**: Synchronous communication lacks the ability to handle sudden increases in traffic effectively.

**Example**: In a ticket reservation system, a frontend service must wait for the backend service to complete several operations before providing a response to the user. This creates a delay and can be problematic if the backend service crashes or if there’s a sudden spike in requests.

### Benefits of Message Brokers

#### Decoupling and Asynchronous Processing

Message brokers allow services to communicate without requiring them to be available simultaneously. For instance:
- **Asynchronous Responses**: In the ticket reservation system, the user receives an immediate acknowledgment and the system processes the ticket reservation and payment in the background.
- **Service Decoupling**: Services can be broken down into smaller components, each handling a part of the transaction, and communicate through the message broker.

#### Buffering and Handling Traffic Spikes

Message brokers can queue messages, helping absorb traffic spikes. For example:
- **Order Fulfillment**: In an online store, orders can be queued during high traffic periods and processed sequentially when the load decreases.

#### Publish-Subscribe Pattern

Message brokers support the publish-subscribe pattern where:
- **Multiple Subscribers**: Different services can subscribe to the same channel to receive notifications or updates.
- **Flexible Integration**: New services can be added without altering existing systems, such as adding analytics or notification services.

### Quality Attributes of Message Brokers

- **Fault Tolerance**: Message brokers enhance fault tolerance by allowing services to communicate even if some are temporarily unavailable.
- **Message Reliability**: They prevent message loss, contributing to higher system availability.
- **Scalability**: They help the system scale to handle high traffic by buffering messages.

### Performance Considerations

While message brokers provide superior availability and scalability, they introduce some latency due to the indirection involved. However, this performance penalty is generally minimal for most systems.

## Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

### Problem Addressed by CDNs
Even with distributed web hosting and technologies like Global Server Load Balancing, significant latency remains due to the physical distance between users and hosting servers, as well as the multiple network hops between routers.

### Example of Latency Without CDN
- **User Location**: Brazil
- **Server Location**: East Coast, USA
- **Initial Latency**: 200 milliseconds
- **TCP Connection Latency**: 600 milliseconds (3-way handshake)
- **HTTP Request Latency**: 400 milliseconds
- **Asset Loading Latency**: 2,000 milliseconds
- **Total Latency**: Over 3 seconds

### Introduction to CDNs
- **Definition**: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of servers designed to speed up content delivery to end users.
- **Purpose**: Reduces latency by caching content on edge servers closer to users.
- **Usage**: Delivers webpage content, assets (images, text, CSS, JavaScript), and video streams.

### Benefits of CDNs
1. **Faster Page Loads**: Reduces total latency to under one second by serving cached content from edge servers.
2. **Improved Availability**: Content is distributed, reducing the impact of server issues.
3. **Enhanced Security**: Protects against DDoS attacks by distributing traffic across multiple servers.

# Scalability Patterns

## Load Balancing in Scalable System Architectures

Load balancing is a software architecture pattern used to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers, allowing systems to scale efficiently and maintain performance under high traffic conditions. Single cloud servers are insufficient for handling high volumes of requests, leading to crashes or performance issues. Upgrading servers only postpones the problem. A dispatcher routes incoming requests to available worker servers, enabling load distribution and scalability.

### Use Cases

- **HTTP Requests:** Distributes front-end requests (web/mobile) to back-end servers.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Manages service instances, enabling independent scaling for each service.

### Implementation Methods

- **Cloud Load Balancing Services:**
  - Managed services that route requests and can scale automatically.
  - Avoid becoming a single point of failure.
    ![load-balancing](./images/load-balancing.png)
- **Message Brokers:**
  - Used for asynchronous, one-directional communication between services.
  - Useful for internal load balancing of message queues.
    ![msg-broker](./images/msg-broker-as-internal-load-balancer.png)

### Routing Algorithms

- **Round Robin:** Sequentially distributes requests, suitable for stateless applications. Example: Most of the stateless API's
- **Sticky Sessions:** Routes requests from the same client to the same server, ideal for stateful applications. Example: Banking, Financial transactions, Multipart file upload.
- **Least Connection:** Directs requests to servers with the fewest active connections, suitable for long-term connections. Example: SQL, LDAP.

### Auto Scaling Integration

- **Auto Scaling:** Automatically adjusts the number of servers based on metrics like CPU usage and traffic.
- Works in conjunction with load balancing to optimize resource use and cost.

#### Example of Auto Scaling Integration

**Scenario:**
A cloud-based e-commerce platform experiences variable traffic, with peaks during sales events and lower traffic during off-peak hours.

**Auto Scaling Integration Steps:**

![Auto Scaling](./images/auto-scaling-group.png)

1. **Monitoring and Metrics Collection:**

   - Server instances in the cloud environment run monitoring agents to collect metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and network traffic.

2. **Defining Auto Scaling Policies:**

   - Policies are established based on the collected metrics. For example:
     - **Scale Up Policy:** Add more server instances if the average CPU utilization exceeds 70% for 5 consecutive minutes.
     - **Scale Down Policy:** Remove server instances if the average CPU utilization drops below 30% for 10 consecutive minutes.

3. **Load Balancer Coordination:**

   - The load balancer is configured to recognize the dynamic pool of server instances. It automatically adjusts the routing of incoming requests based on the current set of available instances.

4. **Implementation Example:**
   - **Cloud Load Balancer:** Utilizes a cloud provider's load balancing service to distribute incoming traffic across a pool of identical web server instances.
   - **Auto Scaling Group:** The web server instances are managed as an auto-scaling group within the cloud provider's infrastructure.
   - **Elasticity in Action:**
     - During a flash sale, the traffic spikes, causing the average CPU utilization to rise above 70%. The auto-scaling policy triggers, launching additional server instances to handle the increased load.
     - The load balancer detects the new instances and routes traffic to them, balancing the load.
     - After the sale, as traffic decreases, the average CPU utilization falls below 30%. The auto-scaling policy triggers the removal of excess instances, reducing costs.

**Benefits:**

- **Dynamic Scalability:** Automatically adapts to traffic changes, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces infrastructure costs by scaling down during low-traffic periods.
- **Resilience:** Prevents server overload and potential crashes by distributing the load and adding capacity when necessary.

This example illustrates how auto scaling, combined with a load balancer, efficiently manages variable workloads in a cloud environment, providing both scalability and cost-effectiveness.

## Pipes and Filters Architecture Pattern

![pipes and filter](./images/pipes-and-filter-approach.png)

### Overview

- **Analogy:** Data flows like water through a series of pipes and filters.
- **Components:**
  - **Data Source:** Origin of the data, e.g., backend services, sensors.
  - **Filters:** Isolated software components that process data.
  - **Pipes:** Mechanisms like distributed queues or message brokers that connect filters.
  - **Data Sink:** Final destination for processed data, e.g., databases, external services.

### Key Concepts

- **Filters:** Perform single operations, unaware of the rest of the pipeline.
- **Pipes:** Can store data temporarily or use message systems for notifications.


### Benefits

1. **Decoupling:**
   - Allows different processing tasks to use different programming languages and technologies.
2. **Hardware Optimization:**
   - Each task can run on the most suitable hardware (e.g., specialized hardware for machine learning).
3. **Scalability:**
   - Each filter can be scaled independently based on workload needs.

### Real-World Use Cases

- **Digital Advertising:** Processing streams of user activity data.
- **Internet of Things (IoT):** Data processing from end devices.
- **Media Processing:**
  - Video and audio processing pipelines, including chunking, thumbnail creation, resolution resizing, adaptive streaming, and captioning.

### Example: Video Sharing Service

1. **Video Processing Pipeline:**

![video-sharing-arch](./images/video-sharing-service-architecture.png)

- **Chunking:** Split video into smaller chunks.
- **Thumbnail Extraction:** Select frames as thumbnails.
- **Resolution and Bitrate Adjustment:** Resize chunks for adaptive streaming.
- **Encoding:** Encode chunks into different formats.

2. **Audio Processing Pipeline:**
   - **Transcription:** Convert speech to text.
   - **Captioning and Translation:** Provide captions and translate into different languages.
   - **Content Moderation:** Detect copyrighted or inappropriate content.

### Considerations

1. **Complexity:**
   - Maintaining this architecture can be complex, especially with granular filters.
2. **Stateless Filters:**
   - Each filter should be independent and stateless.
3. **Transaction Handling:**
   - Not suitable for scenarios requiring a single transaction across the entire pipeline.

The pipes and filters pattern is valuable for scenarios needing flexible, scalable, and decoupled processing pipelines but may not be ideal for transactional data processing.


## Scatter-Gather Architecture Pattern

![scatter-gatherer-pattern](./images/scatter-gatherer-pattern.png)

### Overview

- **Components:**
  - **Sender/Requester:** Initiates the request.
  - **Workers:** Respond to the request; can be internal or external services.
  - **Dispatcher:** Distributes the request to all workers and collects responses.
  - **Aggregator:** Combines responses from workers into a single response.

### Key Concepts

- **Parallel Processing:**
  - Requests are sent to all workers simultaneously, allowing for parallel processing.
  - Workers can be diverse, performing different functions or accessing different data.

### Use Cases

1. **Search Services:**

![search service](./images/serach-service.png)

   - Users send a query, and internal workers search through various data subsets.
   - Results are aggregated and returned as a ranked list.

2. **Hospitality Services:**

![Hospitatlity service](./images/hospitality-service.png)

   - A request for hotel availability is sent to multiple hotels.
   - Responses are collected and sorted based on criteria like price or rating.

### Considerations

1. **Timeouts:**
   - Set an upper limit for waiting for worker responses to avoid delays due to unresponsive workers.
2. **Decoupling:**
   - Use a message broker to decouple the dispatcher and workers, facilitating asynchronous communication.
3. **Long-running Tasks:**
   - For tasks requiring extensive processing, separate the dispatcher and aggregator.
   - Use unique identifiers for tracking and retrieving results.

### Example Workflow

1. **Immediate Response Use Case:**

   - Dispatcher sends a request to workers.
   - Workers process and return responses quickly.
   - Aggregator compiles the results and sends them to the user.

2. **Long-running Task Use Case:**
   - Dispatcher assigns a unique ID to the request and sends it to workers.
   - Workers return partial results with the same ID.
   - Aggregator stores and compiles results, accessible via the unique ID.

#### Benefits

- **Scalability:**
  - Supports high scalability by enabling parallel processing across numerous workers.
- **Flexibility:**
  - Can integrate diverse internal and external services.
- **Resilience:**
  - Can continue processing even if some workers are unavailable or slow.

The scatter-gather pattern is versatile and widely used in many production systems, providing efficient parallel processing and aggregation of results.

## Execution Orchestrator Pattern

![executor-orchestrator](./images/executor-orchestrator-pattern.png)

### Overview
- **Purpose:** Manages a sequence of operations across multiple services in microservices architecture.
- **Analogy:** Like a conductor in an orchestra, the orchestrator directs services without performing the business logic itself.

### Key Concepts
- **Execution Orchestrator:** A centralized service that:
  - Calls different services in the right order.
  - Handles exceptions and retries.
  - Maintains the state of the flow until completion.
- **Microservices:** Individual services responsible for specific business logic, typically stateless and independently scalable.

### Use Case Example: Video on Demand Service

![Video on Demand Service](./images/video-on-demand-user-onboarding.png)

- **User Registration Flow:**
  1. User fills out a registration form (username, password, payment).
  2. **Orchestrator Service** handles:
     - **User Service:** Validates username and password.
     - **Payment Service:** Authorizes credit card via a third-party API.
     - **Location Service:** Registers user location for content access.
     - **Recommendation Service:** Sets up user preferences.
     - **Email Service:** Sends a confirmation email with details.

### Considerations
1. **Scalability:** 
   - Orchestrator and microservices can be scaled independently.
   - Orchestrator can be deployed across multiple instances for reliability.
2. **Failure and Recovery:**
   - Orchestrator handles errors, retries, and manages the flow's state.
   - Maintains a database to persist the state for recovery in case of failures.
3. **Avoiding Monolithic Tendencies:**
   - Keep the orchestrator focused on coordination, not business logic.

### Benefits
- **Decoupling:** Microservices operate independently and are unaware of the orchestration.
- **Efficiency:** Supports parallel and sequential operations.
- **Flexibility:** Easy to modify the flow by updating the orchestrator.

This pattern is particularly useful in complex systems requiring coordination of multiple independent services, offering a scalable and maintainable solution for executing business logic workflows.

## Choreography Pattern

![Choreography Pattern](./images/choregraphy-pattern.png)

### Overview
- **Purpose:** Helps scale complex flows of business transactions in microservices architecture.
- **Comparison:** Unlike the orchestration pattern, choreography uses asynchronous events without a central orchestrator.

### Key Concepts
- **Microservices:** Decoupled services that communicate through a message broker.
- **Message Broker:** A distributed message queue that stores and distributes events.

### Advantages
- **Loose Coupling:** Services operate independently and are not tightly coupled through a central orchestrator.
- **Scalability:** Easy to add or remove services and scale operations.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Services can be implemented as functions that only run when triggered, saving resources.

### Example: Job Search Service

![Job Search Service](./images/job-search-service.png)

1. **User Registration:** 
   - User submits a form with their details and resume.
   - **Candidate Service:** Stores data and emits an event.
2. **Email Confirmation:** 
   - Triggered by the event, an email confirmation is sent to the user.
3. **Skills Parsing:** 
   - **Skills Parser Service:** Extracts and stores skills data, then emits an event.
4. **Job Search:** 
   - **Job Search Service:** Searches for job matches and emits results as an event.
5. **Job Notifications:** 
   - **Candidate Service:** Updates user records.
   - **Email Service:** Sends job notifications based on user preferences.

### Considerations
1. **Debugging Challenges:** 
   - Troubleshooting issues can be difficult due to lack of a central coordinator.
   - Harder to trace the flow of events and identify issues.
2. **Testing Complexity:** 
   - Requires complex integration tests to catch issues before production.
   - Becomes more challenging as the number of services grows.


# Performance Patterns

## MapReduce Pattern
![map-reduce](./images/map-reduce-pattern.png)

### Overview
- **Origin:** Introduced by Jeff Dean and S.J. Ghemawat from Google in 2004.
- **Purpose:** Simplifies processing of large data sets by distributing computation across many machines.

### Key Concepts
- **Map Function:** Transforms input key-value pairs into intermediate key-value pairs.
- **Reduce Function:** Aggregates and processes intermediate pairs to produce final output.

### Example: Word Count in Text Files
1. **Input:** Key-value pairs (filename, content).
2. **Map Function:** Emits (word, 1) for each word in the content.
3. **Shuffle and Sort:** Groups intermediate pairs by word.
4. **Reduce Function:** Sums the counts for each word.

### Architecture

![map-reduce-architecture](./images/map-reduce-architecture.png)
> TODO: Add backup master and snapshot storage in the image


- **Master Node:** Orchestrates the computation, schedules tasks, and handles failures.
- **Worker Nodes:** Execute map and reduce tasks in parallel.
- **Data Distribution:** Input data is split into chunks for parallel processing.

### Fault Tolerance
- **Worker Failures:** Master reassigns tasks and notifies reduce workers of new data locations.
- **Master Failures:** Can either restart the process or use a backup master to continue.

### Cloud Integration
- **Scalability:** Cloud environments provide access to many machines, enabling large-scale data processing.
- **Cost Efficiency:** MapReduce's batch processing nature means paying only for resources used during the job, not for maintaining idle machines.


## Saga Pattern

### Introduction
- **Context:** Microservices architecture, where each service has its own database.
- **Problem:** Ensuring data consistency across multiple databases without a central database, losing traditional ACID transactions.

### Solution: Saga Pattern

![distributed-transaction](./images/saga-pattern-distributed-transaction-success.png)
![distributed-rollback](./images/distributed-rollback.png)

- **Definition:** Manages data consistency in distributed transactions by breaking them into a series of local transactions. If an operation fails, compensating transactions are executed to roll back.

### Implementation Methods
1. **Execution Orchestrator Pattern:**
   - A central orchestrator service manages the transaction flow, calling services sequentially.
   - Decides whether to continue or rollback based on service responses.

2. **Choreography Pattern:**
   - No central orchestrator; services communicate through a message broker.
   - Each service listens for events and triggers subsequent steps or compensations as needed.

### Example Scenario: Ticket Reservation System

![Ticket Reservation System](./images/movie-ticketing-system.png)

1. **Services Involved:** Order, Security, Billing, Reservation, Email, (Orchestration if using orchestrator pattern).
2. **Process:**
   - **Order Service:** Registers an order and sets it to pending.
   - **Security Service:** Validates the user (not a bot or blacklisted).
   - **Billing Service:** Authorizes the pending transaction on the user's credit card.
   - **Reservation Service:** Reserves the ticket for the user.
   - **Email Service:** Sends a confirmation email.

3. **Failure Handling:**
   - If any service returns a failure, compensating operations are triggered:
     - Cancel pending transactions.
     - Remove records from databases.
   - Compensating operations ensure consistency by undoing previous steps if necessary.

### Conclusion
- **Purpose:** Maintains data consistency in a microservices environment by handling distributed transactions.
- **Flexibility:** Can be implemented using either the execution orchestrator pattern or the choreography pattern.
- **Resilience:** Provides mechanisms to complete transactions or roll back in case of failures.

The saga pattern is crucial for ensuring reliable operations and consistency in complex systems with distributed architectures.

## Transactional Outbox Pattern

### Overview
- **Problem:** In event-driven architectures, ensuring that a database update and an event publication occur together reliably can be challenging. Specifically, there's a risk of losing events or data if a system crash occurs between these operations.

![Transactional Outbox Pattern](./images/transactional-outbox-pattern.png)

### Solution: Transactional Outbox Pattern
- **Concept:** Involves adding an **Outbox Table** to the database to store messages intended for the message broker. Updates to both the business logic table (e.g., users) and the Outbox Table are performed within a single database transaction.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Database Update and Message Logging:**
   - Instead of sending an event directly to the message broker, the service logs the message to the Outbox Table along with updating the primary business logic table.
   - Ensures atomicity: Both tables are updated together, or neither is, preventing partial updates.

2. **Message Sender/Relay Service:**
   - A separate service monitors the Outbox Table for new messages.
   - Upon finding a new message, it sends it to the message broker and marks it as sent (or deletes it).

### Addressing Potential Issues
1. **Duplicate Events:**
   - **Cause:** A crash between sending a message and marking it as sent can result in duplicate events.
   - **Solution:** Implement "at least once" delivery semantics. Each message gets a unique ID. Consumers track processed message IDs to discard duplicates.

2. **Lack of Transaction Support:**
   - **Scenario:** Some databases, especially NoSQL ones, may not support multi-collection transactions.
   - **Solution:** Embed the Outbox message directly within the same document (or object) in the database. The sender service queries for documents with messages, sends them, and then clears the messages.

3. **Ordering of Events:**
   - **Problem:** Ensuring the order of related events, such as a user signup followed by a cancellation.
   - **Solution:** Assign each message a sequential ID. The sender service can then sort and send messages in the correct order based on these IDs.

### Conclusion
- **Benefits:** The transactional outbox pattern provides a robust solution for ensuring data consistency and reliable event publication in distributed systems.
- **Considerations:** Addressing potential issues like duplicate events, lack of transaction support, and event ordering is crucial for effective implementation.

The transactional outbox pattern is an essential tool for maintaining consistency in microservices architectures, particularly in systems that rely heavily on event-driven communication.

## Materialized View Pattern

### Overview
- **Purpose:** To optimize performance and cost efficiency in data-intensive applications by pre-computing and storing query results.

![Materialized View Pattern](./images/materialized-views.png)

### Problem Statement
1. **Performance:** Complex queries, especially those involving multiple tables or databases, can be slow.
2. **Cost:** Repeatedly running the same complex queries can be resource-intensive, leading to high costs in a cloud environment.

### Solution: Materialized View
- **Concept:** Create a read-only table (materialized view) that stores the pre-computed results of a specific query. This allows for quick data retrieval without recalculating the query each time.

### Implementation
1. **Data Storage:**
   - Store materialized views as separate tables in the same database or in a read-optimized separate database.
   - In cases of frequent data updates, the materialized view can be regenerated immediately or on a fixed schedule.

2. **Example Use Case:**
   - **Scenario:** An online education platform with tables for courses and reviews.
   - **Need:** Display top courses based on average ratings for a specific topic.
   - **Solution:** Create a materialized view storing pre-computed course ratings, which can be filtered quickly based on the topic.

3. **Benefits:**
   - **Performance:** Significantly reduces query time by avoiding complex aggregations and joins.
   - **Cost Efficiency:** Saves resources by reducing the need for repeated complex query execution.

### Considerations
1. **Storage Space:** Materialized views require additional storage, increasing costs. The trade-off between performance and space must be evaluated.
2. **Update Frequency:** 
   - **Same Database:** If the database supports materialized views, updates can be automatic and efficient.
   - **External Storage:** Requires manual or programmatic updates, which can add complexity.

### Conclusion
- The materialized view pattern is a powerful tool for optimizing the performance of data-intensive applications. By pre-computing and storing query results, this pattern improves user experience and reduces operational costs, especially in environments where resource usage incurs significant expenses.

## CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation)

### Overview
- **Purpose:** To separate the command (write) and query (read) responsibilities in a system into distinct services and databases, optimizing each for its specific workload.

![cqrs-pattern](./images/cqrs-pattern.png)

### Key Concepts
1. **Command Operations:** Actions that mutate data, such as insertions, updates, and deletions.
2. **Query Operations:** Actions that read and return data without altering it.

### Benefits of CQRS
1. **Separation of Concerns:** 
   - Command service handles business logic, validations, and data mutations.
   - Query service focuses solely on data retrieval and presentation.
2. **Independent Scalability:** 
   - The number of instances for each service can be scaled independently based on demand.
3. **Optimized Data Models:** 
   - Command database can be optimized for write operations.
   - Query database can be optimized for read operations, often using different database technologies.

### Example Use Case: Online Store
- **Command Side:** 
  - Stores user reviews in a relational database.
  - Ensures business logic, such as validating purchases and review content.
- **Query Side:** 
  - Stores reviews and average ratings in a NoSQL database, optimized for quick retrieval.
  - Contains pre-aggregated data to minimize real-time computations.

### Synchronization
- **Event Publishing:** 
  - On data mutation, the command service publishes events to keep the query database updated.
  - Can use message brokers or functions-as-a-service for event handling and data synchronization.
- **Eventual Consistency:** 
  - The system guarantees eventual consistency between command and query databases but not strict consistency.

### Considerations
- **Complexity:** 
  - Requires managing multiple services, databases, and synchronization mechanisms.
  - Adds overhead but provides significant performance benefits.
- **Eventual Consistency:** 
  - Suitable for scenarios where eventual consistency is acceptable, not for strict consistency requirements.


## Combining CQRS and Materialized View Patterns in Microservices

### Overview
- **Problem:** In a microservices architecture, data is often split across multiple services and databases, making it challenging to aggregate data efficiently for queries.
- **Solution:** Use a combination of CQRS and materialized view patterns to optimize data retrieval and maintain synchronization across services.

![CQRS and Materialized View Patterns](./images/cqrs-materialized-view.png)

### Key Concepts
1. **Microservices Split:** 
   - Initially, all data might reside in a single database. Splitting into microservices involves dividing this data into separate databases, each handled by a specific service.
   - This division prevents traditional join operations across different microservices' databases.

2. **Performance Challenges:** 
   - Aggregating data across multiple services requires API calls, database queries, and programmatic joins, leading to significant performance overhead.

### Solution: Combining Patterns
1. **CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation):**
   - Create a new microservice with a read-optimized database specifically for querying aggregated data.
   - This microservice only handles queries and does not perform data mutations.

2. **Materialized View:**
   - A materialized view is created to pre-aggregate and store relevant data from multiple microservices.
   - The view includes data necessary for user queries, combining information from different microservices.

### Synchronization Methods
1. **Message Broker:**
   - Each microservice publishes events to a message broker when data changes.
   - The query microservice listens to these events and updates the materialized view accordingly.

2. **Cloud Function:**
   - A function as a service monitors tables in different services' databases.
   - On detecting changes, the function updates the materialized view in the query database.

### Real-World Example: Online Education Platform
- **Setup:**
  - *Courses Microservice:* Manages course data (name, description, price).
  - *Reviews Microservice:* Handles reviews and ratings.
  - *Course Search Service:* New service with a materialized view that includes course details and reviews.

- **Data Flow:**
  - Changes in the course details or reviews trigger events.
  - The Course Search Service updates its materialized view based on these events, ensuring quick access to aggregated data.

### Benefits
- **Efficient Data Aggregation:** 
  - Combines data from multiple microservices into a single, query-optimized view.
- **Performance Optimization:** 
  - Reduces the need for complex, runtime data joins and minimizes latency.
- **Scalability and Maintainability:** 
  - Isolates query logic, making it easier to maintain and scale based on query load.

### Conclusion
- The combination of CQRS and materialized views effectively addresses the challenges of data aggregation in microservices architectures. This approach optimizes data retrieval, maintains synchronization, and allows for scalable and maintainable systems.

## Event Sourcing Pattern

### Overview
Event sourcing is an architecture pattern where the state of an application is derived from a sequence of events rather than storing the current state directly.

![event sourcing](./images/event-sourcing.png) 

### Traditional Data Handling
- **CRUD Operations:** Applications typically use Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to manage data, focusing on the current state.
- **Current State:** The database stores the current state of entities, and any modifications overwrite previous states.

### Need for Event Sourcing
- **Limited by Current State:** In some cases, knowing only the current state isn't sufficient. Historical data or the sequence of changes may be crucial.
- **Examples:**
  - **Banking:** Clients need to see transaction histories, not just current balances.
  - **E-commerce:** Merchants might need to understand inventory changes, not just the current stock level.

### Event Sourcing Explained
- **Events Over State:** Instead of the current state, the system stores events that describe changes or facts about entities.
- **Immutability:** Events are immutable; once logged, they cannot be changed.
- **Replaying Events:** The current state is derived by replaying all events related to an entity.

### Benefits of Event Sourcing
- **Complete History:** Retains a full history of changes, useful for auditing and troubleshooting.
- **Performance:** Improved write performance, as events are appended rather than updating a state.

### Storing Events
1. **Database:** Each event can be stored as a record, allowing for complex queries and analytics.
2. **Message Broker:** Events can be published for consumption by other services, ensuring order and scalability.

### Challenges and Optimizations
- **Replaying All Events:** Reconstructing state by replaying all events can be inefficient.
  - **Snapshots:** Periodically save the current state to reduce the number of events replayed.
  - **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Separate systems for handling commands (writes) and queries (reads). This allows for efficient read operations using a read-optimized database.

### Combining Event Sourcing and CQRS
- **Eventual Consistency:** Combining these patterns often results in eventual consistency, which may be acceptable depending on the use case.
- **Benefits:**
  - **Auditing and History:** Complete record of all changes.
  - **Efficient Writes and Reads:** Separate systems optimize performance.

## Big Data Processing and Lambda Architecture

### Overview

In big data processing, two main strategies exist: batch processing and real-time processing. Batch processing allows for deep insights into historical data and the fusion of data from various sources, but it has a higher delay between data collection and availability for querying. Real-time processing provides immediate visibility and response to incoming data but is limited to recent information without deep historical context.

### The Challenge

Deciding between batch and real-time processing can be difficult, as many systems require the benefits of both strategies. For instance, systems that aggregate logs and performance metrics, or those used in ride-sharing services, need both real-time insights for immediate actions and historical analysis for detecting patterns and optimizing performance.

### Lambda Architecture

![Lambda Architecture](./images/lambda-pattern.png)

The Lambda Architecture addresses this challenge by combining batch and real-time processing, offering the best of both worlds. It consists of three layers:

1. **Batch Layer**: 
   - Manages the master dataset as a system of records, storing immutable data.
   - Pre-computes batch views for in-depth analysis and data corrections.
   - Operates on the entire dataset for perfect accuracy.

2. **Speed Layer**: 
   - Handles real-time data processing to provide low-latency views.
   - Processes data as it arrives and updates real-time views.
   - Focuses on recent data without complex corrections or historical context.

3. **Serving Layer**: 
   - Merges data from both batch and real-time views.
   - Responds to ad-hoc queries, providing a comprehensive view combining historical and real-time data.

### Practical Application

A practical example of Lambda Architecture is in the ad tech industry, where advertisers and content producers interact through an ad-serving system. The system must process three types of events: ad views, ad clicks, and user purchases. These events are processed by both the batch and speed layers to provide:

- Real-time data, such as the number of users currently viewing ads.
- Combined data for queries like the total ads shown in the last 24 hours, merging batch and speed layer data.
- In-depth analysis, like determining the return on investment for advertisers, which requires historical data fusion and analytics.

### Conclusion

Lambda Architecture effectively handles scenarios requiring both real-time and batch processing capabilities. It allows for comprehensive data analysis and immediate responsiveness, making it a versatile solution for modern big data systems.

# Software Extensibility Patterns 

## Extensibility Patterns: Sidecar

### Overview
The **Sidecar** pattern is an extensibility pattern used to extend the functionality of a service without embedding additional logic directly into the service. This approach allows for modular and scalable systems.

### Problem to Solve
- **Additional Functionality Needs:** Services often require extra capabilities like logging, monitoring, or configuration management, beyond their core business logic.
- **Challenges:**
  - **Library Reuse:** In a multi-language environment, reusing libraries across services is impractical and can lead to inconsistencies.
  - **Separate Services:** Deploying shared functionalities as separate services can be excessive and complex.

### Sidecar Pattern

![Sidecar Pattern](./images/sidecar-pattern.png)

- **Analogy:** Like a sidecar on a motorcycle, this pattern adds extra functionality as a separate process or container alongside the main service.
- **Benefits:**
  - **Isolation:** Provides separation between the core service and the sidecar, reducing potential conflicts.
  - **Shared Resources:** Both the main service and the sidecar share the same host, allowing fast and reliable communication.
  - **Language Independence:** Sidecars can be implemented in any language and reused across different services.
  - **Simplified Updates:** Updates to sidecar functionalities can be rolled out across all services simultaneously.

### Ambassador Sidecar
- **Function:** A specific type of sidecar that acts as a proxy for handling network requests.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Complexity Offloading:** Manages network communication complexities, including retries, authentication, and routing.
  - **Simplified Core Service:** Keeps the core service focused on business logic, while the ambassador handles network concerns.
  - **Distributed Tracing:** Enables instrumentation and tracing across services, aiding in troubleshooting and isolating issues.


## Anti-Corruption Adapter Pattern

### Introduction
The **Anti-Corruption Adapter Pattern** is a crucial software architecture pattern used to manage interactions between systems with different technologies, protocols, or data models. It prevents the corruption of a new system by the legacy system during integration or migration processes.

### Scenarios and Solutions

![Anti-Corruption Adapter Pattern](./images/anti-corruption-adapter.png)

1. **Migration from Monolith to Microservices:**
   - **Problem:** During migration from a monolithic system to microservices, new services may need to interact with old technologies, APIs, or data models. This can corrupt the clean design of new services.
   - **Solution:** Implement an Anti-Corruption Adapter (ACA) service that acts as a mediator. The ACA translates communications, allowing new microservices to interact with the monolithic application using modern technologies, while the monolith continues to operate as before.

2. **Coexistence with Legacy Systems:**
   - **Problem:** Sometimes, parts of the legacy system cannot be fully migrated or replaced due to various constraints, such as high costs or critical dependencies.
   - **Solution:** The ACA enables the new system to leverage legacy components without inheriting outdated logic or technologies. This allows the legacy system to remain as-is, while the new system evolves independently.

### Benefits
- **Isolation:** The ACA isolates new and old systems, preventing legacy logic from contaminating new architectures.
- **Seamless Integration:** It allows for smooth interaction between systems with different technologies or data models.
- **Gradual Migration:** Facilitates gradual migration from old to new systems without disrupting business operations.

### Challenges
- **Development and Maintenance:** The ACA itself is a service that requires development, testing, and maintenance like any other component.
- **Performance Overhead:** The translation process can introduce latency and may require scaling to avoid becoming a bottleneck.
- **Cost:** In a cloud environment, the ACA can incur additional costs, particularly if run continuously. Deploying it as a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) can help mitigate these costs if usage is infrequent.

### Conclusion
The Anti-Corruption Adapter Pattern is valuable for maintaining the integrity and cleanliness of new systems while interacting with legacy components. It is particularly useful in scenarios involving system migration or the need for long-term coexistence with legacy systems. However, it comes with trade-offs, including potential latency and additional costs.

This pattern helps balance the evolution of technology stacks while minimizing disruption and preserving system integrity.

## Backends for Frontends (BFF) Pattern

### Introduction
The **Backends for Frontends (BFF)** pattern addresses the challenges of supporting different frontend applications (e.g., web, mobile, desktop) with a single monolithic backend. This pattern involves creating separate backend services, each tailored to the specific needs and features of a particular frontend.

### Problem Statement
In a typical e-commerce system with a microservices architecture:
- The frontend code running in browsers interacts with a backend that serves static and dynamic content.
- Over time, as the system grows and more frontend types (e.g., mobile, desktop) are introduced, the backend becomes complex, supporting diverse features and device-specific needs.
- This complexity leads to a monolithic backend that struggles to provide optimal experiences for different devices.

### Solution: BFF Pattern

![BFF Pattern](./images/backends-for-frontends.png)

The BFF pattern proposes creating distinct backend services for each frontend type:
- **Frontend-Specific Backends:** Each backend service is dedicated to a particular frontend, containing only the relevant functionality. This results in smaller, more manageable codebases and services that can be optimized for specific devices (e.g., mobile vs. desktop).
- **Full Stack Teams:** Teams can work as full stack developers, managing both the frontend and the corresponding backend, streamlining the development and deployment process.

### Benefits
- **Optimized User Experience:** Each backend is tailored to the unique capabilities and needs of its corresponding frontend, providing a better user experience.
- **Reduced Complexity:** Smaller, frontend-specific backends are easier to manage and evolve.
- **Independent Development:** Teams can work independently without depending on a separate backend team, reducing coordination overhead.

### Challenges
1. **Shared Functionality:**
   - **Duplication Risk:** There may be shared logic or business rules needed across multiple backends (e.g., authentication, checkout process).
   - **Solutions:** 
     - **Shared Libraries:** Suitable for small, stable pieces of logic but can lead to tight coupling and maintenance issues.
     - **Separate Services:** Creating dedicated services for shared functionality with clear APIs and ownership, ensuring consistency without duplication.

2. **Granularity Decision:**
   - Determining the appropriate level of granularity depends on the uniqueness of the experiences across different platforms. For example, separate backends for Android and iOS are justified if their user experiences are significantly different.

3. **Cloud Deployment Considerations:**
   - In a cloud environment, smaller and less powerful virtual machines can replace the original monolithic backend. The choice of hardware can be optimized for the specific demands of each frontend (e.g., CPU or memory requirements).
   - Load balancing can be used to route requests to the appropriate backend, using URL paths, parameters, or HTTP headers like the user agent.

### Conclusion
The BFF pattern helps manage the complexity and scalability of systems supporting multiple frontend types by creating dedicated backends. This approach improves user experience, reduces development friction, and allows for independent and efficient development. However, it requires careful management of shared functionality and thoughtful decisions regarding service granularity.

# Reliability & Error Handling Patterns

## Throttling or Rate Limiting Pattern

### Introduction
The **Throttling or Rate Limiting** pattern is designed to enhance system reliability by controlling the rate at which resources are consumed. It helps prevent overconsumption of system resources, whether due to malicious activity, legitimate high traffic, or interactions with external services.

### Problem Statement

![Rate Limiting Pattern](./images/rate-limiting-pattern.png)

Two main issues this pattern addresses:
1. **Overconsumption of Resources:** 
   - High request rates can lead to system overload, potentially causing slowdowns or outages.
   - Unexpected traffic spikes can trigger costly auto-scaling, resulting in financial strain.
2. **Overspending on External Services:** 
   - Systems interacting with external APIs or cloud services can accidentally consume more resources than budgeted, leading to unexpectedly high costs.

### Types of Throttling
1. **Server-Side Throttling:** 
   - Limits the number of requests to protect the system's backend from overconsumption.
   - Common in scenarios where the system serves multiple clients through an API.

2. **Client-Side Throttling:** 
   - Prevents a client from exceeding a predetermined budget when calling external services.
   - Used when a system consumes external APIs or cloud services to avoid overspending.

### Strategies for Handling Exceeding Limits
1. **Dropping Requests:** 
   - Requests exceeding the rate limit are dropped. An error response (e.g., HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests") can inform the client.
   - Suitable for non-critical services like fetching real-time data (e.g., stock prices).

2. **Queuing Requests:** 
   - Requests are queued and processed later when capacity allows.
   - Useful for critical operations like executing trades, where delaying is preferable to dropping.

3. **Service Degradation:** 
   - Adjust service quality instead of dropping or delaying requests, such as reducing video quality in streaming services.
   - Can also set an upper limit on resource usage, like the number of media items accessed per day.

### Considerations for Implementation
1. **Global vs. Customer-Based Throttling:**
   - **Global Throttling:** A single limit applies to all clients, ensuring overall system stability but risking unfair resource allocation.
   - **Customer-Based Throttling:** Individual limits for each client, ensuring fair resource distribution but complicating total request rate management.

2. **External vs. Service-Based Throttling:**
   - **External Throttling:** Limits based on the overall number of API calls from clients, straightforward but can lead to internal service overload.
   - **Service-Based Throttling:** Specific limits for internal services, requiring complex tracking but better protecting individual system components.

### Conclusion
Throttling is crucial for maintaining system reliability and controlling costs. The choice between different throttling strategies—global vs. customer-based, external vs. service-based—depends on the specific use case and system requirements. Understanding these considerations helps in implementing an effective throttling strategy that balances performance, cost, and resource allocation.

## Retry Pattern

### Introduction
The **Retry Pattern** is a reliability architecture pattern used to handle errors by retrying operations that have failed. This pattern helps recover from transient issues in a system, such as network failures or temporary unavailability of services.

### Problem Statement
In cloud environments, errors can occur at any time due to software, hardware, or network issues. When a client calls a service, which in turn may call another service, these errors can cause delays, timeouts, or outright failures. The Retry Pattern aims to handle such situations by retrying failed operations.

### Key Considerations

![Retry Pattern](./images/retry-service.png)

1. **Error Categorization:**
   - **User Errors:** Errors caused by invalid user actions (e.g., HTTP 403 Unauthorized). These should not be retried; instead, return the error to the user.
   - **System Errors:** Internal errors that may be transient and recoverable (e.g., HTTP 503 Service Unavailable). These are candidates for retries.

2. **Choosing Errors to Retry:**
   - Only retry errors that are likely to be temporary and recoverable, such as timeouts or service unavailability.

3. **Delay and Backoff Strategies:**
   - **Fixed Delay:** A constant delay between retries (e.g., 100 ms).
   - **Incremental Delay:** Increasing the delay gradually after each retry (e.g., 100 ms, 200 ms, 300 ms).
   - **Exponential Backoff:** Exponentially increasing delay (e.g., 100 ms, 200 ms, 400 ms, 800 ms) to reduce load on recovering services.

4. **Randomization (Jitter):**
   - Adding randomness to the delay helps spread out retry attempts, reducing the chance of overloading the system simultaneously.

5. **Retry Limits and Time Boxing:**
   - Set limits on the number of retries or a maximum time period for retries to prevent indefinite retry attempts.

6. **Idempotency:**
   - Ensure that retrying an operation does not cause unintended side effects, such as double billing in a payment system. Only idempotent operations should be retried safely.

7. **Implementation Strategies:**
   - **Shared Library:** Implement retry logic in a reusable library or module.
   - **Ambassador Pattern:** Separate the retry logic from the main application code by running it as a separate process on the same server.

### Conclusion
The Retry Pattern is a simple yet effective method for handling transient errors in a system. However, careful implementation is crucial to avoid pitfalls like retry storms, and to ensure retries are applied only in appropriate situations. Properly applying the Retry Pattern can enhance system reliability and provide a smoother experience for users.

## Circuit Breaker Pattern

### Introduction
The **Circuit Breaker Pattern** is a software architecture pattern used to handle long-lasting errors and prevent cascading failures. It contrasts with the Retry Pattern, which is used for short, recoverable issues. The Circuit Breaker Pattern prevents requests from being sent to a failing service, thus saving resources and improving system stability.

### Real-Life Example
Consider an online dating service that fetches profile images from an image service. If the image service is down for a significant time, retrying requests is futile. Instead, using a circuit breaker can prevent further attempts and conserve resources.

### Key Concepts

![Circuit Breaker Pattern](./images/circuit-breaker-pattern.png)

1. **Circuit States:**
   - **Closed:** All requests are allowed through, and the system tracks success and failure rates.
   - **Open:** No requests are allowed through; failures are assumed to continue. The system immediately returns errors.
   - **Half-Open:** A limited number of requests are allowed to test if the service has recovered.

2. **Operation**
   - The circuit starts in a **Closed** state, allowing requests and tracking failures. If failures exceed a certain threshold, the circuit moves to an **Open** state, blocking requests. After a timeout, it transitions to a **Half-Open** state to test the service's health. Depending on the results, it either closes the circuit or returns to the open state.

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Handling Requests in Open State:**
   - **Drop Requests:** Simply ignore them, with proper logging for analysis.
   - **Log and Replay:** Record the requests for later processing, useful in critical systems like e-commerce.

2. **Response Strategy in Open State:**
   - **Fail Silently:** Return empty responses or placeholders (e.g., a placeholder image in a dating app).
   - **Best Effort:** Provide cached or old data if available.

3. **Separate Circuit Breakers for Each Service:**
   - Each external service should have its own circuit breaker to prevent one failing service from affecting others.

4. **Asynchronous Health Checks:**
   - Instead of real requests in the Half-Open state, use small, asynchronous health checks to determine service recovery. This approach conserves resources and reduces impact on the recovering service.

5. **Implementation Location:**
   - As with the Retry Pattern, the Circuit Breaker can be implemented as a shared library or through an Ambassador Sidecar, especially useful for services in different programming languages.

### Conclusion
The Circuit Breaker Pattern is crucial for managing long-lasting errors, preventing resource waste, and improving system resilience. It involves careful consideration of how to handle failed requests, the state management of the circuit, and the method of implementation. Properly implementing this pattern can significantly enhance the stability and reliability of a distributed system.

## Dead Letter Queue Pattern

### Overview
The **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** pattern is designed to handle message delivery failures in an event-driven architecture. It helps manage errors in publishing and consuming messages through a message broker or distributed messaging system.

### Event-Driven Architecture

![Dead Letter Queue Pattern](./images/dead-letter-q.png)

In an event-driven system, three key components are involved:
- **Event Publishers:** Produce messages or events.
- **Message Broker:** Manages channels, topics, or queues for message distribution.
- **Consumers:** Read and process incoming messages.

While this architecture offers benefits like decoupling and scalability, it also introduces potential points of failure.

### Real-Life Example
Consider an online store with:
- **Order Service:** Publishes order events.
- **Inventory, Payment, Fulfillment Services:** Subscribe to these events and process them based on the product type (physical vs. digital).

Potential issues include:
- Order service publishing to a non-existent or full queue.
- Consumers facing issues reading or processing messages, which could clog the queue and delay other messages.

### Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

1. **Purpose:**
   - A special queue for messages that cannot be delivered or processed successfully.
   - Helps in isolating problematic messages and preventing them from affecting the main queue.

2. **Message Entry into DLQ:**
   - **Programmatic Publishing:** Consumers or publishers manually move messages to the DLQ if they encounter issues.
   - **Automated Configuration:** Message brokers can be configured to automatically move messages to the DLQ due to delivery failures or other issues.

3. **Configuration Support:**
   - Most open-source or cloud-based message brokers support DLQ functionality.

4. **Processing Messages in DLQ:**
   - **Monitoring and Alerting:** Regular monitoring ensures that messages in the DLQ are addressed and not forgotten.
   - **Error Details:** Attach headers or additional information to messages to understand and fix issues.
   - **Handling:**
     - **Automatic Republishing:** Once issues are resolved, messages can be moved back to the original queue for normal processing.
     - **Manual Processing:** Rare cases or special scenarios might require manual intervention.


# Deployment Patterns

## Rolling Deployment

**Overview:**
The Rolling Deployment pattern is used for upgrading production servers without significant downtime. It involves gradually replacing application instances with a new version while maintaining service availability.

![Rolling Deployment](./images/rolling-deployment.png)

**How It Works:**
1. **Load Balancing:** Stop sending traffic to one server at a time using a load balancer.
2. **Upgrade:** Replace the old application instance with the new version on the server.
3. **Testing:** Optionally run tests on the upgraded server.
4. **Reintegration:** Add the updated server back into the load balancer's rotation.
5. **Repeat:** Continue the process for all servers until all are running the latest version.

**Benefits:**
- **No Downtime:** The system remains operational throughout the upgrade.
- **Gradual Release:** New versions are released gradually, reducing risk compared to a "big bang" approach.
- **Cost-Effective:** No need for additional hardware or infrastructure.

**Downsides:**
- **Cascading Failures:** New versions might cause failures that could impact old servers still in operation.
- **Compatibility Issues:** Running two versions side by side may cause issues if the new version is not fully compatible with the old one.


## Blue Green Deployment

**Overview:**
The Blue Green Deployment pattern is used to release a new version of software by maintaining two separate environments—Blue and Green. This approach aims to minimize risks and ensure a smooth transition between versions.

**How It Works:**

![Blue Green Deployment](./images/blue-gree-deployment.png)

1. **Blue Environment:** The old version of the application continues running on this set of servers.
2. **Green Environment:** A new set of servers is provisioned, and the new version of the application is deployed here.
3. **Verification:** After deployment, the new instances in the Green environment are tested to ensure they work as expected.
4. **Traffic Shift:** Traffic is gradually redirected from the Blue environment to the Green environment using a load balancer.
5. **Rollback:** If issues are detected, traffic can be switched back to the Blue environment. If all is well, the Blue environment can be decommissioned or kept for the next release cycle.

**Benefits:**
- **No Downtime:** The Blue environment remains operational during the transition, ensuring continuous service availability.
- **Safe Rollbacks:** If problems arise, traffic can be easily shifted back to the old version, minimizing risk.
- **Consistent User Experience:** Customers experience only one version of the software at a time, reducing compatibility issues.

**Downsides:**
- **Increased Costs:** Running both Blue and Green environments simultaneously means needing twice the server capacity during the release.
- **Resource Usage:** Additional servers are required, which can lead to higher operational costs.


## Canary Release and A/B Testing

**Canary Release:**
The Canary Release pattern blends elements from both rolling and blue-green deployment strategies to offer a balanced approach to deploying new software versions.

**How It Works:**

![Canary Release](./images/canary-release.png)

1. **Initial Deployment:** Deploy the new version of the software to a small subset of existing servers (the Canary servers).
2. **Traffic Management:** Redirect either all or a subset of traffic (e.g., internal users or beta testers) to these Canary servers.
3. **Monitoring:** Observe the performance and functionality of the Canary servers compared to the rest of the servers running the old version.
4. **Rollout Decision:** If the Canary version performs well, gradually update the rest of the servers using a rolling release approach. If issues arise, traffic can be shifted back to the old servers.

**Benefits:**
- **Reduced Risk:** Issues affect only a small subset of users, making it easier to manage and rollback if needed.
- **Informed Decisions:** Provides confidence in the new version before a full-scale deployment.
- **Selective Traffic:** Directs traffic from internal users or beta testers to mitigate potential impacts.

**Challenges:**
- **Monitoring Complexity:** Requires clear success criteria and effective automation to monitor performance.
- **Resource Allocation:** Needs careful management to ensure that monitoring and rollback processes are efficient.

**A/B Testing:**
A/B Testing is similar to Canary Release but focuses on testing new features rather than full software versions.

![AB Testing](./images/ab-testing.png)

**How It Works:**
1. **Experimental Deployment:** Deploy a new feature or version on a small subset of servers.
2. **User Segmentation:** Redirect a portion of real user traffic to these experimental servers.
3. **Data Collection:** Gather data on user interactions and performance metrics.
4. **Evaluation:** Analyze the results to determine if the new feature should be rolled out to all users or if changes are needed.

**Benefits:**
- **Real User Feedback:** Provides genuine insights into how users interact with the new feature.
- **Informed Decisions:** Helps make data-driven decisions about future features or changes.
- **Testing in Production:** Allows testing of features under real-world conditions.

**Challenges:**
- **User Awareness:** Users are typically unaware they are part of an experiment, which can complicate feedback collection.
- **Reversion Process:** Requires careful handling to revert back to the original version after testing.


## Chaos Engineering

**Overview:**
Chaos Engineering is a production testing technique used to improve the resilience and reliability of distributed systems by deliberately injecting controlled failures into a live environment. This approach helps identify and address potential weaknesses before they lead to catastrophic issues during unexpected real-world events.

![Chaos Engineering](./images/chaos-engineering-testing.png)

**Why Chaos Engineering?**
- **Inevitability of Failures:** In distributed systems, failures are inevitable due to infrastructure issues, network problems, or third-party outages.
- **Limitations of Traditional Testing:** Traditional testing methods (unit tests, integration tests) may not capture all possible failure scenarios, especially those that occur in production environments.

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Controlled Failures:** Introduce failures such as server terminations, latency, resource exhaustion, or loss of access to simulate potential issues.
2. **Monitoring and Analysis:** Observe how the system responds to these failures and analyze the performance.
3. **Improvement:** Identify and fix any issues found during testing to enhance system resilience.

**Common Failures to Inject:**
- **Server Termination:** Randomly terminate servers to test system recovery and redundancy.
- **Latency Injection:** Introduce delays between services or between a service and its database.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Fill up disk space or other resources to observe how the system handles resource limitations.
- **Traffic Restrictions:** Disable traffic to specific zones or regions to test failover mechanisms.

**Process of Chaos Engineering:**
1. **Baseline Measurement:** Establish a performance baseline before injecting failures.
2. **Hypothesis Formation:** Define expected behavior and system responses.
3. **Failure Injection:** Introduce the failure and monitor its impact.
4. **Documentation:** Record findings and observations during the test.
5. **Restoration:** Restore the system to its original state post-testing.
6. **Continuous Improvement:** Address identified issues and continuously test to ensure ongoing resilience.

**Considerations:**
- **Minimize Blast Radius:** Ensure failures are contained and do not excessively impact the system.
- **Error Budget:** Avoid promising 100% availability; maintain flexibility for unexpected and deliberate failures.


# Ways of Communicating Between Different Components of Software

There are several ways of communicating between different components of software, each suited to specific use cases and architectural requirements. Some common methods of communication include:

1. **Synchronous Communication:**

   - **Remote Procedure Calls (RPC):** In RPC, a client component invokes a procedure or method on a remote server and waits for a response before proceeding. This communication method is often used in client-server architectures for synchronous interactions between components.

2. **Asynchronous Communication:**

   - **Message Queues:** Message queues enable asynchronous communication between components by decoupling producers and consumers of messages. Components send messages to a queue, and consumers retrieve and process messages from the queue at their own pace. Message queues are commonly used in distributed systems for tasks such as workload distribution, event-driven processing, and integration between disparate systems.
   - **Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub):** Pub/Sub messaging involves publishers broadcasting messages to a topic or channel, which multiple subscribers can then receive and process asynchronously. Pub/Sub messaging is widely used for event-driven architectures, real-time data processing, and broadcasting updates to multiple subscribers.
   - **Event Bus:** An event bus facilitates communication between components by enabling them to publish and subscribe to events. Components can publish events to the bus, and other components can subscribe to receive and process those events asynchronously. Event buses are commonly used in microservices architectures and event-driven systems for loosely coupled communication between components.

3. **Remote Communication Protocols:** **HTTP/HTTPS:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its secure variant HTTPS are widely used for communication between web-based components, APIs, and services over the internet. HTTP-based communication is stateless and follows a request-response model, making it suitable for client-server interactions in distributed systems. Here are differnt achitectural patterns when using HTTP/HTTPS
   - **RESTful APIs:** Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for designing networked applications, typically using HTTP as the communication protocol. RESTful APIs provide a uniform interface for accessing and manipulating resources using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and resource identifiers (URLs).
   - **GraphQL**: GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that enables clients to request specific data from servers. It allows clients to specify the structure of the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data compared to traditional REST APIs. GraphQL is commonly used in modern web applications to improve efficiency and flexibility in data fetching.
   - **Web Services**: Web services enable communication between software components or systems over the internet using standardized protocols such as SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (Representational State Transfer). Web services provide interoperability between different platforms and languages, allowing components to communicate regardless of their underlying technologies.
   - **WebSocket:** WebSocket is a communication protocol that enables bidirectional, full-duplex communication between web clients and servers over a single, long-lived connection. WebSocket is commonly used for real-time web applications, chat applications, and streaming data processing.

4. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication:** In P2P communication, components communicate directly with each other without relying on centralized servers or intermediaries. P2P networks enable decentralized data exchange, distributed computing, and collaboration among peers.

   - **BitTorrent Protocol:** BitTorrent is a widely used protocol for distributed file sharing and peer-to-peer file transfer. It enables peers (nodes) in a network to collaborate in sharing and downloading files by dividing them into smaller pieces and distributing them among peers. BitTorrent uses a combination of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for data transfer between peers.
   - **Napster Protocol:** Napster was one of the earliest P2P protocols used for sharing music files over the internet. It employed a centralized server to index and coordinate file sharing among peers. However, it was eventually shut down due to legal issues related to copyright infringement.
   - **Gnutella Protocol:** Gnutella is a decentralized P2P protocol used for distributed file sharing and communication. It allows peers to connect directly to each other without relying on centralized servers. Gnutella uses a query-response mechanism for searching and downloading files from other peers in the network.
   - **Kademlia Protocol:** Kademlia is a distributed hash table (DHT) protocol used for decentralized P2P networks, such as those used in distributed storage systems and cryptocurrency networks (e.g., Ethereum). It organizes nodes in the network into a peer-to-peer overlay network and provides efficient lookup and storage of key-value pairs.
   - **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):** IPFS is a protocol and network designed to create a distributed file system that can be used to store and share content in a P2P manner. It uses content-addressable storage and cryptographic hashes to ensure data integrity and supports features such as content addressing, versioning, and peer-to-peer file sharing.

These are just a few examples of protocols used in P2P networks. Depending on the specific application and requirements, other protocols or custom protocols may also be used to facilitate communication and data exchange among peers in a P2P network.

5. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):**

   - **Shared Memory:** Shared memory allows multiple processes to access and modify shared data structures residing in the same memory space. This communication method is often used for high-performance data exchange between closely coupled processes running on the same machine.
   - **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Mechanisms:** IPC mechanisms such as pipes, sockets, and message passing enable communication between processes running on the same machine or across networked systems. These mechanisms facilitate data exchange, synchronization, and coordination between independent processes or components.

## Data Formats

- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** JSON is a lightweight data interchange format commonly used for serializing and transmitting structured data between components in web-based systems and APIs.
- **XML (eXtensible Markup Language):** XML is a markup language for encoding structured data in a human-readable format. Although less common than JSON, XML is still used in certain contexts for data exchange and interoperability between systems.
- **Protocol Buffers (protobuf):** Protocol Buffers is a binary serialization format developed by Google for efficiently encoding structured data. Protocol Buffers are often used in performance-critical applications and microservices architectures for fast and compact data transmission.
- **GraphQL (Graph Query Language):** GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that enables clients to request specific data from servers. It provides a flexible and efficient alternative to traditional REST APIs by allowing clients to specify the structure of the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data. GraphQL is commonly used in modern web applications for data fetching and manipulation.
- **Apache Avro:** Avro is a binary serialization format developed within the Apache Hadoop project for efficient data serialization and data exchange between systems. It provides features such as schema evolution, data compression, and rich data types, making it suitable for use in big data processing frameworks such as Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, and Apache Hadoop.
- **MessagePack:** MessagePack is a compact binary serialization format designed for efficient data serialization and exchange between systems. It encodes data in a space-efficient binary format, resulting in smaller message sizes and faster data transmission compared to JSON or XML. MessagePack supports a wide range of data types and is commonly used in high-performance applications and network protocols.
- **Thrift:** Thrift is a binary serialization and RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework developed by Facebook for efficient communication and data exchange between services. It provides a schema-based approach to define data types and services, enabling cross-language compatibility and efficient serialization and deserialization of data. Thrift is commonly used in large-scale distributed systems for inter-service communication.
- **Apache Arrow:** Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data processing. It provides a columnar memory layout and standardized data interchange format for efficient data exchange between different systems and programming languages. Apache Arrow is commonly used in data processing frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, and Pandas for high-performance data analytics and processing.
- **Cap'n Proto:** Cap'n Proto is a data interchange format and RPC framework developed by the creators of Protocol Buffers. It offers high-performance serialization and deserialization of data using a zero-copy, memory-mapped approach. Cap'n Proto supports schema evolution, efficient data encoding, and cross-language compatibility, making it suitable for use in distributed systems and network protocols.

These communication methods and protocols provide a range of options for facilitating communication between different components of software, allowing developers to choose the most appropriate approach based on the specific requirements, constraints, and architectural considerations of their systems.

# Data Storage

## Introduction to Data Storage Techniques

In today's digital age, data is one of the most valuable assets for organizations. Efficient and reliable data storage techniques are essential for managing, accessing, and protecting this data. Whether it's structured data like databases, unstructured data such as documents and media files, or semi-structured data like JSON and XML files, choosing the right storage solution can significantly impact performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency.

### Key Considerations in Data Storage

1. **Scalability**: As the volume of data grows, the storage system must be able to scale seamlessly.

   - **Network Attached Storage (NAS)**: Provides file-level access to data over a network, suitable for centralized data storage and sharing.
   - **Distributed File Systems**: Allow data to be stored across multiple machines. Examples include Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Google File System (GFS).

3. **Object and Cloud Storage**:
   - **Object Storage**: Stores data as objects, each with a unique identifier, metadata, and the actual data. It is highly scalable and ideal for large amounts of unstructured data.
   - **Cloud Storage**: A form of object storage provided by cloud service providers, offering scalable and flexible solutions without the need for on-premises infrastructure. It includes various storage classes for different access patterns and durability requirements. Examples include Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage.

4. **Block Storage**:
   - Offers low-level storage for data blocks, suitable for applications requiring fast access and high performance. Commonly used for databases and virtual machines. Examples include Amazon EBS and Azure Disk Storage.

### Conclusion

Selecting the appropriate data storage technique depends on the specific needs of the organization, including data type, access patterns, performance requirements, and budget. By understanding the strengths and limitations of each storage solution, businesses can ensure efficient data management and maintain a competitive edge in the digital landscape.


## Techniques for Improving Database Performance, Availability, and Scalability

In large-scale systems, the performance, availability, and scalability of databases are critical. This lecture covers three essential techniques to enhance these aspects: **indexing**, **replication**, and **partitioning**.

### 1. Indexing

**Indexing** is a technique used to speed up the retrieval of records from a database. It achieves this by creating a separate structure, known as an index, that maps column values to their corresponding rows.

![Indexing](./images/indexing.png)

- **Purpose**: Speed up queries by avoiding full table scans.
- **Examples**:
  - Searching for users in a specific city.
  - Sorting users by last name, age, or income.
- **How It Works**: 
  - Single-column index: Maps column values to records.
  - Composite index: Maps a combination of column values to records.
  - Can be stored in data structures like hashmaps (for fast lookups) or B-Trees (for sorted views).
- **Trade-offs**: 
  - Increases read query speed but can slow down write operations due to the need to update indexes.
  - Requires additional storage space.

### 2. Database Replication

**Database replication** involves creating copies of the database on multiple servers. This enhances fault tolerance and availability by ensuring that if one instance fails, others can continue to serve queries.

![Database Replication](./images/data-replication.png)

- **Benefits**:
  - **High Availability**: Multiple replicas ensure that data is available even if one instance fails.
  - **Increased Throughput**: Distributes the load among multiple instances, handling more queries.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Consistency**: Managing concurrent updates and ensuring data consistency across replicas can be complex.
  - **Complexity**: Requires careful design and management, especially for write operations.

### 3. Database Partitioning (Sharding)

**Database partitioning**, or sharding, divides a database into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be distributed across different servers. Each partition holds a subset of the data, which can significantly improve performance and scalability.

![Data Partitioning](./images/data-partitioning.png)

- **Advantages**:
  - **Scalability**: Allows for more data storage and handling larger datasets by distributing data.
  - **Performance**: Enables parallel processing of queries on different shards.
- **Considerations**:
  - **Complexity**: Increases the complexity of the system, especially with query routing and maintaining balanced data distribution across shards.
  - **Supported Features**: Less common in relational databases due to the complexity of handling multi-record transactions and joins across shards.

### Conclusion

These three techniques—**indexing**, **replication**, and **partitioning**—are fundamental in designing robust, large-scale database systems. They are not mutually exclusive and are often used together to provide a balance of performance, availability, and scalability. Proper implementation of these techniques requires understanding the trade-offs and complexities involved, particularly in distributed systems.

In summary, by leveraging these techniques, we can create database systems that efficiently handle large volumes of data and high request loads, ensuring a responsive and reliable experience for users.


# Specialized Storage

5. **In-Memory Databases**: In-memory databases store data entirely in RAM (random-access memory) for faster access and lower latency compared to disk-based storage. They are commonly used for caching, real-time analytics, and high-performance data processing. Examples include Redis, Memcached, and Apache Ignite.

6. **Time-Series Databases**: Time-series databases specialize in storing and analyzing time-stamped data points or events. They are optimized for time-series data, such as sensor data, metrics, and logs, and provide features for efficient storage, indexing, and querying of time-series data. Examples include InfluxDB, Prometheus, and TimescaleDB.

7. **Search Indexes**: Search indexes store and index textual data for fast and efficient full-text search operations.

# Relational Databases

Relational databases are a fundamental component of many software systems, offering a structured approach to storing and managing data. Let's explore the key aspects of relational databases:

## Overview

Relational databases organize data into tables, where each table consists of rows and columns. The relationships between tables are defined by primary and foreign keys, enforcing referential integrity and enabling complex data querying and manipulation.

## Key Components

- Tables: Tables represent entities or relationships in the database schema. Each table has a defined structure with columns representing attributes and rows representing individual records.
- Columns: Columns define the attributes or fields of a table, such as data types (e.g., integer, string, date) and constraints (e.g., primary key, foreign key, not null).

### Primary Keys

Primary keys uniquely identify each record in a table and enforce entity integrity. They must be unique and not null.

### Foreign Keys

Foreign keys establish relationships between tables by referencing the primary key of another table. They enforce referential integrity and maintain data consistency across related tables.

### Indexes

Indexes improve query performance by enabling fast retrieval of data based on specified columns. They are created on columns frequently used in search and retrieval operations.

### Constraints

Constraints enforce data integrity rules, such as uniqueness, referential integrity, and domain integrity, ensuring that data meets specified criteria.
