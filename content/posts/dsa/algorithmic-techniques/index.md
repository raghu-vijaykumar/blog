Algorithmic techniques are strategies used to design efficient algorithms for solving computational problems. Here are some of the most common and powerful algorithmic techniques:

## 1. **Divide and Conquer**

- **Concept**: Break the problem into smaller subproblems, solve each subproblem recursively, and combine their solutions to solve the original problem.
- **Examples**:
  - **Merge Sort**: Divides the array into two halves, sorts each half, and merges them.
  - **Quick Sort**: Divides the array based on a pivot, sorts the subarrays recursively.

## 2. **Dynamic Programming**

- **Concept**: Break the problem into overlapping subproblems, solve each subproblem once, and store their solutions in a table to avoid redundant computations.
- **Examples**:
  - **Fibonacci Sequence**: Uses memoization or tabulation to avoid recomputing Fibonacci numbers.
  - **Knapsack Problem**: Determines the maximum value that can be obtained from a set of items with given weights and values.

## 3. **Greedy Algorithms**

- **Concept**: Make a series of choices, each of which is locally optimal, with the hope that these choices lead to a globally optimal solution.
- **Examples**:
  - **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Finds the minimum spanning tree for a graph by adding the smallest edge that doesn’t form a cycle.
  - **Huffman Coding**: Builds an optimal prefix-free code for data compression.

## 4. **Backtracking**

- **Concept**: Explore all possible solutions by incrementally building candidates and abandoning those that fail to satisfy the problem constraints.
- **Examples**:
  - **N-Queens Problem**: Places N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
  - **Sudoku Solver**: Fills the grid cells while ensuring all Sudoku rules are followed.

## 5. **Branch and Bound**

- **Concept**: Systematically enumerate candidate solutions by branching and applying bounds to eliminate unpromising candidates.
- **Examples**:
  - **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: Finds the shortest possible route visiting a set of cities and returning to the origin city.
  - **Knapsack Problem**: Similar to dynamic programming but uses bounding to eliminate suboptimal solutions.

## 6. [**Sliding Window**](/blog/posts/dsa/sliding-window/)

- **Concept**: Maintain a subset of elements in a window that moves over the data structure to solve problems related to subarrays or substrings.
- **Examples**:
  - **Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K**: Finds the maximum sum of subarray of length K.
  - **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## 7. [**Two-Pointer Technique**](/blog/posts/dsa/two-pointer/)

- **Concept**: Use two pointers to iterate through the data structure from different ends to solve problems efficiently.
- **Examples**:
  - **Two Sum**: Finds two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a target.
  - **Container With Most Water**: Finds two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that holds the most water.

## 8. **Graph Algorithms**

- **Concept**: Utilize specialized algorithms to solve problems related to graph data structures.
- **Examples**:
  - **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Traverses or searches graph data structures.

- **Examples**:
  - **Counting Bits**: Counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of an integer.
  - **Subset Generation**: Generates all possible subsets of a set using bit manipulation.

## 10. **Sorting and Searching**

- **Examples**:
  - **Binary Search**: Searches for an element in a sorted array in logarithmic time.
  - **Merge Sort**: Efficiently sorts an array using the divide and conquer technique.

## 11. **Mathematical Algorithms**

- **Concept**: Use mathematical principles to solve problems.
- **Examples**:
  - **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: Finds the greatest common divisor of two numbers using Euclidean algorithm.
