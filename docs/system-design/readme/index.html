By investing time and effort into designing robust and efficient systems, organizations can build high-quality software products that meet the needs of their users and stakeholders.\nRequirements Gathering, Classifying, and Analyzing Purpose:\nDetermine what needs to be built for the client. Clarify high-level and vague requirements, often provided by non-technical clients. Challenges:\nScope and Ambiguity: Large-scale systems involve broader scope and higher ambiguity than smaller tasks. Communication: Transform vague client requests into precise technical requirements. Importance:\nEnsuring accurate requirements upfront is critical to avoid costly rework and delays. Large projects involve significant engineering time, hardware, software licenses, and contractual obligations. Types of Requirements:\nFunctional Requirements (Features): Describe the system’s behavior and functionalities (e.g., user login, payment processing). Non-Functional Requirements (Quality Attributes): Define properties like scalability, reliability, performance, and security. System Constraints: Include limitations such as deadlines, budget, and team size. Architectural Drivers:\nRequirements that influence architectural decisions and shape the system’s design. Capturing and Documenting Functional Requirements Purpose:\nDefine and document functional requirements methodically. Challenges:\nComplexity and ambiguity, especially with many features and actors. Methodology:\nUse Cases and User Flows: Use Case: Describes specific scenarios where the system is used to achieve a user’s goal. User Flow: Detailed, often graphical, representation of each use case. Steps to Capture Functional Requirements:\nIdentify Actors: Determine all users and actors interacting with the system. Describe Use Cases: List all scenarios of interaction between actors and the system. Expand Use Cases: Detail the flow of events and interactions in each use case, capturing actions and data flow. Example - Hitchhiking Service:\nActors: Driver and Rider. Use Cases: User registration (Rider and Driver). Logging in to initiate a ride. Successful match between Rider and Driver. Unsuccessful match (no driver found). Sequence Diagrams:\nUsed to represent interactions between actors and the system. Features: Time progresses from top to bottom. Entities represented as vertical lines. Communication shown as arrows; responses as broken lines. Application of Sequence Diagrams:\nExample: Successful match in hitchhiking service. Steps include driver availability, rider request, matching process, ride initiation, ride completion, payment, and notifications. API Identification:\nEach interaction in the user flow can correspond to an API call. Data flowing between actors and the system forms the basis for API arguments. Key Takeaway:\nThe three-step process and sequence diagrams provide a structured way to capture and visualize functional requirements, aiding in system design and API identification. Quality Attributes (Nonfunctional Requirements) Motivation:\nSystems are often redesigned due to inadequate quality attributes, not because of functional deficiencies. Proper architecture that addresses quality attributes can prevent costly redesigns. Definition:\nQuality attributes describe the qualities of the system’s functionality, measuring performance on specific dimensions. They do not specify what the system does, but how well it performs. Examples:\nPerformance: System responds to a search query within 100 milliseconds. Availability: Online store available 99.9% of the time. Deployability: System can be updated with new versions at least twice a week. Key Considerations:\nMeasurability and Testability:\nQuality attributes must be quantifiable and verifiable. E.g., defining “quickly” in terms of specific time, like 200 milliseconds. Trade-offs:\nNo single architecture can optimize all quality attributes. Conflicting requirements require prioritization (e.g., speed vs. security in login processes). Feasibility:\nEnsure the system can realistically meet the quality attributes. Unrealistic expectations (e.g., 100% availability, perfect security) should be addressed early. Examples of Unfeasible Requirements:\nUnrealistic low latency (e.g., sub-100ms page loads with high network latency). 100% system availability (no maintenance or upgrades). Full protection against hackers. Streaming high-resolution content in low-bandwidth areas. Conclusion:\nQuality attributes are critical for system success. They must be measurable, involve trade-offs, and be feasible. Proper consideration of these attributes helps avoid major redesigns and ensures system reliability and performance. System Constraints Definition:\nSystem constraints are pre-determined decisions that restrict architectural choices, either fully or partially. They can be viewed as non-negotiable guidelines that shape the architecture. Types of System Constraints:\nTechnical Constraints:\nRelated to hardware, cloud vendors, programming languages, databases, platforms, browsers, or operating systems. Example: Using a specific database due to existing infrastructure. Business Constraints:\nArising from budget, deadlines, or business strategies. Example: Limited budget or a strict deadline influences the choice of architecture. Legal Constraints:\nRelated to regulations and laws specific to regions or industries. Example: Compliance with HIPAA for healthcare systems or GDPR for handling personal data in the EU. Considerations:\nDistinguishing Real vs. Self-Imposed Constraints:\nDetermine if constraints are truly non-negotiable or if there’s room for flexibility. Example: Re-evaluating the need for specific technologies or exploring alternative vendors. Avoiding Tight Coupling:\nDesign the architecture to allow future flexibility and minimize dependency on specific constraints. Example: Abstracting the interaction with a specific database or third-party service to facilitate easy replacement. Conclusion:\nSystem constraints are a key architectural driver that define the boundaries within which the system must operate. Properly identifying and managing these constraints helps in creating a resilient and adaptable architecture. Ensuring flexibility in the system design allows for easier adaptation to future changes and potential relaxation of constraints. Quality Attribute: Performance Overview:\nPerformance is a crucial quality attribute in large-scale systems. It encompasses various metrics that measure how efficiently a system processes requests and data. Performance Metrics:\nResponse Time:\nDefined as the time taken between sending a request and receiving a response. It includes: Processing Time: Time spent actively handling the request within the system. Waiting Time: Time spent in transit or in queues, often referred to as latency or end-to-end latency. Importance: Critical for user experience, especially in systems where immediate feedback is expected. Throughput:\nMeasures the amount of work or data processed by the system per unit of time. Can be expressed as tasks per second or data (bytes) per second. Importance: Vital for systems handling large volumes of data, such as logging or analytics systems. Considerations for Measuring Performance:\nAccurate Measurement of Response Time:\nEnsure that both processing and waiting times are considered to avoid misleading conclusions about system performance. Response Time Distribution Analysis:\nUse histograms and percentile distributions to understand the range of response times experienced by users. Key terms: Median: The 50th percentile, indicating the response time for 50% of requests. Tail Latency: The response times in the higher percentiles (e.g., 95th, 99th), indicating the longest delays experienced by a small percentage of users. Setting Goals: Define acceptable response times in terms of percentiles, e.g., 95th percentile response time should be under 30 milliseconds. Performance Degradation:\nIdentify the point at which performance degrades as load increases. Key factors include CPU utilization, memory consumption, network limitations, and queue capacities. Importance: Understanding degradation helps in capacity planning and ensuring system stability under load. Conclusion:\nPerformance metrics like response time and throughput are essential for assessing system efficiency and user experience. Proper measurement and analysis of these metrics, including consideration of tail latency and performance degradation, are crucial for maintaining a high-quality system. Quality Attribute: Scalability Motivation for Scalability:\nSystem load or traffic is dynamic and can vary based on seasonal patterns, daily fluctuations, global events, and business growth. As the load increases, systems may reach a performance degradation point, beyond which performance declines. Definition of Scalability:\nScalability is the ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work in a cost-effective and easy manner by adding resources. Ideal scalability scenarios include: Linear Scalability: Doubling resources results in doubling the amount of work the system can handle. Diminishing Returns: Adding resources provides decreasing increments in performance improvement. Negative Scalability: Adding resources worsens performance due to overhead and coordination costs. Scalability Dimensions:\nVertical Scalability (Scaling Up):\nInvolves upgrading the existing hardware (e.g., faster CPUs, more memory) to handle increased load. Pros: Simple to implement; does not typically require code changes. Easy migration, especially with cloud services. Cons: Limited by the maximum capacity of a single machine. Centralized system design, which lacks high availability and fault tolerance. Horizontal Scalability (Scaling Out):\nInvolves adding more instances of the same resource, such as multiple servers or databases, to distribute the load. Pros: Virtually unlimited scalability potential. Can inherently provide high availability and fault tolerance. Cons: More complex to implement and manage, requiring significant changes in system architecture. Increased coordination and management overhead. Team or Organizational Scalability:\nFocuses on increasing the productivity of the development team as more engineers are hired. Challenges: Increased coordination overhead, meetings, and merge conflicts as team size grows. Larger codebases require more onboarding and testing time, slowing down productivity. Solutions: Modularization: Splitting the codebase into separate modules or libraries to reduce interference. Microservices: Breaking down a monolithic application into independent services with separate codebases and release cycles. Conclusion:\nScalability is a critical quality attribute that ensures a system can grow and adapt to increasing demands. It can be achieved through vertical scalability (upgrading hardware), horizontal scalability (adding more instances), and team scalability (enhancing team productivity). Understanding and implementing scalability strategies helps maintain system performance, reliability, and organizational efficiency as the system and team grow. Quality Attribute: Availability Importance of High Availability:\nUser Impact: Availability directly affects user experience. Downtime can lead to frustration and loss of trust, especially if critical services (e.g., e-commerce, email, mission-critical systems) are inaccessible. Business Impact: Revenue Loss: When systems are down, the ability to generate revenue halts. Customer Loss: Frequent or prolonged outages can drive users to competitors. Defining Availability:\nAvailability: The fraction of time or probability that a service is operational and accessible to users. Uptime: The time when the system is operational and accessible. Downtime: The time when the system is not operational or accessible. Measuring Availability:\nBasic Formula: [ \\text{Availability} = \\frac{\\text{Uptime}}{\\text{Uptime} + \\text{Downtime}} ] MTBF and MTTR: MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures): The average time the system operates without failure. MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery): The average time taken to detect and recover from a failure. Alternative Formula: [ \\text{Availability} = \\frac{\\text{MTBF}}{\\text{MTBF} + \\text{MTTR}} ] This formula indicates that minimizing MTTR can significantly improve availability, even if MTBF is not optimal. Acceptable Levels of Availability:\n100% Availability: Ideal but impractical due to maintenance and unexpected failures.\nIndustry Standards:\n90% Availability: Over two hours of downtime per day, not considered high availability. 95% Availability: About one hour of downtime per day, still insufficient for most use cases. 99.9% Availability (Three Nines): Less than 1.5 minutes of downtime per day, generally acceptable. 99.99% Availability (Four Nines): Less than 52.6 minutes of downtime per year, highly reliable. Terminology: Availability percentages are often referred to by the number of nines (e.g., “three nines” for 99.9%).\nAchieving High Availability: Fault Tolerance Strategies Sources of Failures:\nHuman Error: Mistakes like deploying faulty configurations, incorrect commands, or untested software versions. Software Errors: Problems such as long garbage collections, crashes (out-of-memory exceptions, null pointer exceptions, segmentation faults), etc. Hardware Failures: Issues like server, router, or storage device failures due to end-of-life, power outages from natural disasters, or network problems. Fault Tolerance Overview:\nDefinition: The ability of a system to remain operational and available to users despite failures in one or more components. Objective: Ensure system operation at the same or reduced performance level, preventing complete unavailability. Fault Tolerance Tactics:\nFailure Prevention:\nEliminating Single Points of Failure: Replication and Redundancy: Multiple Instances: Run applications or databases on multiple servers to avoid single points of failure. Time Redundancy: Repeating operations until successful or abandoned. Architectural Strategies: Active-Active Architecture: All replicas handle requests and must stay synchronized. Offers scalability but requires complex coordination. Active-Passive Architecture: A primary replica handles all requests, with passive replicas maintaining state through periodic snapshots. Easier to implement but limits scalability. Failure Detection and Isolation:\nMonitoring Systems: Health Checks and Heartbeats: Regular checks to ensure instances are operational. Detection of Faulty Instances: Monitoring for software or hardware issues and isolating affected instances. False Positives vs. False Negatives: Prioritizing avoiding false negatives, where a failure is undetected, over false positives. Recovery from Failure:\nTraffic Management: Redirect traffic from faulty instances. Restart Procedures: Attempt to resolve issues by restarting affected instances. Rollbacks: Revert to a stable version if the current one causes issues, commonly used in databases to maintain data integrity and system stability. Key Terms in Service Level Management Service Level Agreement (SLA):\nDefinition: A legal contract between the service provider and users that outlines the quality of service commitments, such as availability, performance, data durability, and response times to failures. Components: Specifies penalties or compensation if the provider fails to meet the promised quality of service, such as refunds, service credits, or extensions. Application: Primarily for external paying users, but can also apply to free users (e.g., trial extensions) and sometimes internal users. Service Level Objectives (SLOs):\nDefinition: Specific, measurable goals set for a system, representing target values or ranges for key metrics. Examples: Availability (e.g., three nines), response time (e.g., \u003c100ms at the 90th percentile), issue resolution time (e.g., 24-48 hours). Relation to SLA: SLOs are components of an SLA, detailing specific commitments. Systems without an SLA still need SLOs to set user expectations. Service Level Indicators (SLIs):\nDefinition: Quantitative metrics used to assess whether SLOs are being met. They are derived from monitoring systems or log analysis. Examples: Percentage of successful responses (for availability), response times, error rates. Purpose: To measure actual performance against SLO targets and ensure compliance with SLAs. Considerations for Defining SLOs User-Centric Metrics: Focus on the metrics that matter most to users and define SLOs around them. Select SLIs that accurately track these metrics.\nMinimal and Focused SLOs: Limit the number of SLOs to prioritize key objectives and simplify system architecture. Too many SLOs can dilute focus and complicate management.\nRealistic and Conservative Goals: Set achievable goals with a margin for error. Avoid over-promising by aligning external commitments conservatively compared to internal goals.\nRecovery Plan: Prepare a plan for situations where SLIs indicate potential breaches of SLOs. This includes automatic alerts, failovers, restarts, rollbacks, auto-scaling policies, and handbooks for incident management.\nThese terms and considerations are crucial for designing reliable systems that meet user expectations and contractual obligations.\nReferences Amazon SLA GCP SLA Azure SLA Github SLA Atlassian Products SLA Designing an Application Programming Interface (API) Introduction and Motivation An API is a contract between the developers who implement a system and the client applications that use it. For large-scale systems, APIs are typically accessed remotely over a network. These client applications can include front-end clients (like mobile apps or web browsers), other backend systems, or internal systems within an organization.\nTypes of APIs Public APIs:\nDefinition: Exposed to the general public; any developer can use them. Access Control: Often require user registration to manage and monitor usage, enhance security, and enable blacklisting. Private APIs:\nDefinition: Only accessible internally within a company, allowing different teams or departments to leverage the system’s capabilities. Partner APIs:\nDefinition: Similar to public APIs but restricted to users or companies with a business relationship, often defined by a customer agreement. Benefits of a Well-Defined API Ease of Use: Clients can enhance their business by integrating with the system without needing to understand its internal workings. Parallel Development: Clients can start integrating with the system based on the API definition, even before the system’s implementation is complete. Internal Architecture: Defining the API helps in designing the internal structure by establishing clear endpoints and routes for different functionalities. Best Practices and Patterns for API Design Encapsulation:\nGoal: Hide internal design and implementation details from API users. Benefit: Allows internal changes without breaking the API contract. Ease of Use and Simplicity:\nGuidelines: Provide a single way to perform tasks. Use descriptive names for actions and resources. Expose only necessary information and actions. Maintain consistency throughout the API. Idempotency:\nDefinition: Operations that produce the same result even if performed multiple times. Importance: Ensures safe retrying of requests in case of network issues, as multiple requests won’t alter the outcome. Pagination:\nPurpose: Handle large datasets by dividing them into manageable chunks. Example: Displaying a limited number of emails or search results at a time, rather than overwhelming the client with the entire dataset. Asynchronous Operations:\nUse Case: For long-running tasks where partial results aren’t meaningful (e.g., big data analysis, large file compression). Mechanism: Clients receive an immediate response with a tracking identifier to check the status and retrieve the final result later. API Versioning:\nPurpose: Manage changes over time, especially non-backward compatible updates. Approach: Maintain multiple API versions, allowing clients to transition gradually while maintaining stability. Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) Introduction and How It Works A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) allows a client application to execute a subroutine on a remote server, making the call appear like a local method invocation. This concept, known as local transparency, simplifies the developer’s experience as the remote method call syntax closely resembles that of local methods. RPCs often support multiple programming languages, enabling interoperability between different systems.\nKey Components:\nInterface Description Language (IDL):\nDefines the API and data types used in the methods. Serves as a schema for communication between the client and server. Stubs:\nClient Stub: Auto-generated implementation for the client, handles serialization (marshalling) of data, and initiates the connection to the server. Server Stub: Auto-generated implementation on the server, listens for client messages, deserializes (unmarshalling) data, and invokes the corresponding method. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):\nAuto-generated classes or structs representing custom data types defined in the IDL. Process Flow:\nThe client calls an RPC method, the client stub serializes the data and sends it to the server. The server stub receives, deserializes, and processes the request, then returns the result. The client stub receives and deserializes the response, providing the result to the caller. Benefits of RPC Convenience:\nSimplifies the developer’s task by abstracting away the complexities of network communication. Error handling is straightforward, with communication failures resulting in exceptions or errors similar to local method calls. Language and Platform Agnosticism:\nMultiple programming languages can be used for both client and server implementations. Drawbacks of RPC Slowness:\nUnlike local methods, RPC calls involve network communication, which can introduce latency and unpredictability in performance. Developers may inadvertently block execution while waiting for slow RPC responses, making it necessary to provide asynchronous versions of potentially slow methods. Unreliability:\nNetwork issues can cause messages to be lost or delayed, leading to confusion about the state of operations. For instance, a failed transaction might leave the client unsure whether an operation was completed. Mitigation:\nUse idempotent operations to ensure repeated calls have the same effect, minimizing risks in case of communication failures. When to Use RPC Backend-to-Backend Communication:\nIdeal for communication between different backend systems or components within a large-scale system. Complete Abstraction:\nSuitable when the goal is to abstract network communication details and focus solely on the actions performed. Action-Oriented APIs:\nRPCs are well-suited for APIs focused on actions rather than data or resources, with methods representing distinct actions. When Not to Use RPC Frontend Clients:\nGenerally less common for frontend clients like web browsers. Need for Network Details:\nNot ideal when direct access to network elements like HTTP cookies or headers is required. Data-Centric APIs:\nFor APIs centered around data and CRUD operations, other styles may be more appropriate. References gRPC Apache Thrift Java RMI REST API: Representational State Transfer Introduction and Overview REST stands for Representational State Transfer, an architectural style introduced by Roy Fielding in 2000. Unlike standards or protocols, REST provides a set of constraints and best practices for designing APIs, primarily for the web. A RESTful API adheres to these principles, offering a resource-oriented approach rather than a method-centric one, as seen in RPC APIs.\nKey Characteristics of REST APIs:\nResource-Oriented: The primary focus is on resources, which represent entities within the system. Statelessness: Each request from a client contains all the information needed for the server to fulfill the request. Cacheability: Responses are explicitly labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable, aiding performance and reducing server load. Comparison with RPC RPC: Focuses on exposing methods and functions to perform operations. REST: Emphasizes resources, where operations are limited to a few standard methods. REST API Concepts Resources and URIs:\nResources represent entities and are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). Organized hierarchically, resources can be simple (individual entities) or collections (groups of entities). Resource Representations:\nResources are represented in various formats like JSON, XML, HTML, or others. The server provides a representation of the resource’s state, which can differ from its internal implementation. Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS):\nREST APIs often include hypermedia links in responses, guiding clients on possible next actions. Key Benefits of REST APIs Scalability: Statelessness allows easy load distribution across multiple servers. High Availability: No dependency on session state enables failover and redundancy. Performance: Caching reduces latency and server load. Naming and Organizing Resources Best Practices: Use nouns for resource names to clearly distinguish resources from actions. Distinguish between collection resources (plural names) and simple resources (singular names). Ensure resource names are clear and meaningful, avoiding generic terms like “items” or “objects”. Resource identifiers should be unique and URL-friendly. Operations on REST API Resources Standard HTTP Methods:\nPOST: Create a new resource. GET: Retrieve the state of a resource or a list of resources in a collection. PUT: Update an existing resource. DELETE: Remove a resource. Idempotency:\nMethods like GET, PUT, and DELETE are idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request. Safety and Cacheability:\nGET requests are safe (do not modify resource state) and cacheable. POST requests can also be cacheable with appropriate headers. Designing a REST API: A Step-by-Step Example Example: Movie Streaming Service\nIdentify Entities:\nUsers, movies, reviews, actors. Map Entities to URIs:\nDefine resources and their hierarchy, e.g., /movies, /movies/{movieId}, /movies/{movieId}/reviews. Define Representations:\nUse JSON to represent resource states, e.g., a movie’s information and links to related resources like reviews and actors. Assign HTTP Methods:\nExample operations: POST on /users: Register a new user. GET on /users/{userId}: Retrieve user information. PUT on /users/{userId}: Update user profile. DELETE on /users/{userId}: Remove a user. Conclusion REST API design emphasizes a resource-oriented approach with a small set of standard operations. This style facilitates high performance, scalability, and ease of use. By following best practices and leveraging HTTP methods, developers can create robust and intuitive APIs.\nKey Principles and Goals of System Design System design aims to achieve several key principles and goals to ensure the success and effectiveness of software systems. Here’s a deep dive into some of the most important ones:\nScalability Description: Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle increasing loads or demands by adding resources or scaling out horizontally without significantly impacting performance.

Software architectural patterns are general, repeatable solutions to commonly occurring system design problems. Unlike design patterns—such as singleton, factory, or strategy—which organize code within a single application, architectural patterns address problems involving multiple components running as separate runtime units, like applications or services.\nOver time, software architects have observed how companies in similar industries solved design challenges. They identified successful strategies and learned from others’ mistakes, thus forming software architectural patterns.\nWhy Use Software Architectural Patterns? Efficiency and Resource Savings: Leveraging proven solutions can save time and resources. If a pattern has worked for organizations with similar challenges, it often makes sense to adopt it rather than reinvent the wheel.\nAvoiding Anti-Patterns: One significant risk is creating a “big ball of mud,” an anti-pattern characterized by a lack of structure, tightly coupled services, global or duplicated information, and unclear component responsibilities. Such systems are difficult to develop, maintain, and scale, potentially harming the business.\nConsistency and Continuity: Using well-known patterns ensures that other engineers and architects can easily understand and continue working within the same architectural framework. This consistency simplifies maintenance and evolution.\nFlexibility and Evolution Architectural patterns are guidelines, not rigid rules. The goal is to define the best architecture for the specific use case and adapt the patterns as necessary. As systems evolve, the chosen pattern may no longer fit, necessitating a migration to a different pattern. Many companies have successfully navigated such transitions, providing best practices for smooth and safe migrations.\nMonolithic Architecture Overview: Monolithic architecture is a traditional software design approach where all components of an application are tightly coupled and interconnected within a single codebase.

This lecture covers three essential techniques to enhance these aspects: indexing, replication, and partitioning.\n1. Indexing Indexing is a technique used to speed up the retrieval of records from a database. It achieves this by creating a separate structure, known as an index, that maps column values to their corresponding rows.\nPurpose: Speed up queries by avoiding full table scans. Examples: Searching for users in a specific city. Sorting users by last name, age, or income. How It Works: Single-column index: Maps column values to records. Composite index: Maps a combination of column values to records. Can be stored in data structures like hashmaps (for fast lookups) or B-Trees (for sorted views). Trade-offs: Increases read query speed but can slow down write operations due to the need to update indexes. Requires additional storage space. 2. Database Replication Database replication involves creating copies of the database on multiple servers. This enhances fault tolerance and availability by ensuring that if one instance fails, others can continue to serve queries.\nBenefits: High Availability: Multiple replicas ensure that data is available even if one instance fails. Increased Throughput: Distributes the load among multiple instances, handling more queries. Challenges: Consistency: Managing concurrent updates and ensuring data consistency across replicas can be complex. Complexity: Requires careful design and management, especially for write operations. 3. Database Partitioning (Sharding) Database partitioning, or sharding, divides a database into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be distributed across different servers. Each partition holds a subset of the data, which can significantly improve performance and scalability.\nAdvantages: Scalability: Allows for more data storage and handling larger datasets by distributing data. Performance: Enables parallel processing of queries on different shards. Considerations: Complexity: Increases the complexity of the system, especially with query routing and maintaining balanced data distribution across shards. Supported Features: Less common in relational databases due to the complexity of handling multi-record transactions and joins across shards. Conclusion These three techniques—indexing, replication, and partitioning—are fundamental in designing robust, large-scale database systems. They are not mutually exclusive and are often used together to provide a balance of performance, availability, and scalability. Proper implementation of these techniques requires understanding the trade-offs and complexities involved, particularly in distributed systems.\nIn summary, by leveraging these techniques, we can create database systems that efficiently handle large volumes of data and high request loads, ensuring a responsive and reliable experience for users.\nSpecialized Storage In-Memory Databases: In-memory databases store data entirely in RAM (random-access memory) for faster access and lower latency compared to disk-based storage.

Unlike high-level design, which provides a broad overview of the system architecture and main components, low-level design dives into the specifics, detailing how individual components should function and interact.\nKey aspects of low-level design include:\nComponent Design: Detailing the internal structure of each component, including classes, methods, data structures, and their relationships.\nAlgorithm Design: Defining the algorithms that components will use to perform their tasks, including the logic and steps involved.\nData Structures: Choosing appropriate data structures to store and manage data efficiently, considering factors such as access patterns, memory usage, and performance.\nInterfaces and APIs: Specifying the interfaces and APIs for components, including input and output formats, and the methods through which components will interact.\nError Handling and Edge Cases: Planning for error conditions and edge cases, ensuring that the system can gracefully handle unexpected situations and maintain stability.\nSecurity Considerations: Implementing security measures to protect data and prevent unauthorized access, including encryption, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.\nPerformance Optimization: Identifying and implementing techniques to optimize the system’s performance, such as caching strategies, efficient algorithms, and resource management.\nDetailed Diagrams and Documentation: Creating diagrams like class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and flowcharts to visually represent the system’s structure and behavior, along with comprehensive documentation to guide implementation and maintenance.\nLow-level design is crucial for translating high-level design concepts into functional and efficient systems. It requires a deep understanding of the problem domain, the chosen technology stack, and best practices in software development. A well-executed low-level design ensures that the system is not only functional but also maintainable, scalable, and efficient.\nCitations The following notes is curated from\nChatGPT Udemy: The

Instead of storing the current state of an entity, Event Sourcing stores a series of state-changing events. These events represent facts that describe changes to the system&rsquo;s state over time. By replaying these events, the application can reconstruct the current state of the system at any point in time.
