Designing HA & DR Most of the services can be differentiated as compute and storage; these are the two key components when building resilient software architectures. Here is a generic diagram for HA and DR.
HA Key Components Auto-Scaling: Adjusts the number of instances based on traffic demands. Load Balancing: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances. Redundancy: Duplication of critical components to prevent single points of failure. DR Key Components Backup and Restore: Regular data backups and efficient restore processes. Replication: Real-time data replication across different locations. Failover Mechanisms: Automatic switch to a standby system in case of failure.

Provide availability zone failure test results to demonstrate application withstand more than one zone failure Confirm each Product/Service deployed to 2 regions (where available/applicable). Provide region failure test results to demonstrate application withstand complete region failure Zero Downtime Deployment Model Blue Green deployment for reducing down-time during deployment and faster rollback if necessary Canary deployment model employed to get early feedback and incremental change into production Deployment/Rollback Procedures fully Automated/Documented to reduce the downtime for all components (Service, Host, Network, DB, Storage, etc.) Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery Define RTO and RPO working with Product/Business Recovery Time Objective - Maximum tolerable time to restore service in case of disaster without consequences Recovery Point Objective - Maximum tolerable amount of data to lose in case of disaster without consequences BC & DR Plan - Developed per the BC & DR compliance guidelines. Provide the Plan. Schedule the DR drill with the DR team. BC Plan - Is a strategy to ensure continuity of operations with minimal disruption. DR Plan - Is to restore data and critical systems in the event of disaster DR Testing - Disaster Recovery Test Execution with PITR (point-in-time recovery) with DR team. DR Documentation - Disaster Recovery exercise results documented. Backup & Restore Use the RPO to determine backup frequency/schedule Product to define data retention policy Persistent data backed-up? Restore procedures tested?

It provides a structured approach to capturing the product’s purpose, functionality, technical specifications, and operational requirements. This documentation not only outlines how the product works but also guides users on its installation, configuration, and usage.
By detailing everything from system requirements and architecture to deployment procedures and support channels, this template ensures that stakeholders from developers and IT teams to end-users and managers have a clear understanding of the product’s capabilities and how to interact with it effectively. It facilitates consistency in development and deployment processes, promotes adherence to regulatory and compliance standards, and supports ongoing maintenance and support efforts.
